This document provides guidance and clarifications for the
implementation of FIXM. It includes general guidance for the
implementation of FIXM (high-level considerations about the usage of
FIXM, general encoding rules…) and more specific FIXM guidance and
examples in support of FF-ICE/1 and of the transition to FF-ICE/1.

This Guidance Document, which is managed by the FIXM CCB, is released as
a recommended practice for FIXM. It is therefore non-normative.
Requirements described in it shall be considered mandatory only for
those aiming to comply with this guidance.

This document aims to build a "community knowledge" about the
implementation of FIXM. It will therefore evolve over time in order to
capture more alternatives, options and recommendations related to the
use of FIXM. Suggested additions, changes and comments on this document
are welcome and encouraged. These suggestions should be sent to the FIXM
CCB (<FIXM.CCB@eurocontrol.int>) or posted to the FIXM Work Area.

The present version of the document provides guidance for the
implementation of **FIXM v4.2.0**.

Purpose and content
-------------------

This document provides guidance and clarifications for the
implementation of FIXM. It aims to build a "community knowledge" about
the implementation of FIXM. It will therefore evolve over time in order
to capture more alternatives, options and recommendations related to the
use of FIXM.

The implementation guidance provided in this document is structured as
follows:

-   **General Guidance on FIXM implementation**

> This chapter provides general guidance for understanding the main FIXM
> components, outlines general requirements for valid FIXM core and FIXM
> extensions usage and describes the general rules (encoding rules, data
> plausibility rules, rules for absent data…) that are always applicable
> whatever the implementation context.

-   **Guidance for** **Using FIXM in Support of FF-ICE**

> This chapter provides specific guidance in support of the
> implementation of FF-ICE using FIXM. It introduces the FF-ICE
> Application Library, identifies a candidate set of FIXM-Based services
> enabling (part of) the information exchanges defined by the ICAO
> ATMRPP in the Manual on FF-ICE Implementation Guidance \[10\] and
> provides detailed examples of FF-ICE/1 Services realizations.

-   **Guidance for** **Translating FF-ICE FIXM Messages to ATS
    Messages**

> This chapter defines a formal mapping between the FIXM Logical Model
> and Air Traffic Services (ATS) message content as defined in ICAO Doc
> 4444 \[8\].

-   **Guidance for** **Using FIXM for other use cases**

> This chapter provides guidance for using FIXM in a context other than
> FF-ICE. In particular, it helps FIXM implementers create their own
> application libraries and extensions.

*Note: The present version of the document captures the guidance
information agreed by the FIXM community as of March 2018. Readers are
invited to monitor the FIXM community discussions in the FIXM Work Area*
*\[6\] about the implementation of FIXM, which may serve as useful
complement or clarification.*

Applicable FIXM version
-----------------------

The present version of the document supports the implementation of the
following FIXM components:

-   **FIXM Core v4.2.0** \[1\]

-   **FF-ICE Application Library v1.0.0**

-   **Basic Messaging v1.0.0**

**What is new in FIXM Core 4.2.0?**

At high level, the scope declaration of FIXM Core 4.2.0 is the same as
FIXM 4.1.0, namely to provide harmonised representation of the flight
data structures exchanged in the context of FF-ICE/R1. FIXM Core 4.2.0
implements however significant improvements compared to FIXM 4.1.0:

-   FIXM Core 4.2.0 is based on a newer version of the draft FF-ICE/1
    Implementation Guidance Manual, therefore reflecting a more mature -
    but yet not 100% final - version of the FF-ICE/1 requirements
    specified by the ICAO ATMRPP;

-   FIXM Core 4.2.0 contains more usable data structures for expressing
    which flight restrictions are violated by an FF-ICE flight plan
    (filed or preliminary) submitted by an eAU. In other terms, FIXM
    Core 4.2.0 enables a better representation of the feedback that an
    eAU can get from an eASP after submitting an FF-ICE flight plan;

-   FIXM Core 4.2.0 supports nillable properties (which FIXM 4.1.0 did
    not) that enable proper FF-ICE Flight Plan updates as described in
    the FF-ICE/1 Implementation Guidance Manual;

-   FIXM Core 4.2.0 comes together with a new FF-ICE Application Library
    that addresses the use of FIXM Core in the specific context of
    FF-ICE and which provides formal representation of the individual
    FF-ICE messages. A new “Basic Message” library is also available in
    order to provide basic messaging support for FIXM.

-   FIXM Core 4.2.0 also implements a number of technical improvements
    and bug corrections.

Important note: This document does not detail the individual changes
implemented in this new FIXM release. More information about these
changes can be found in the FIXM Release Note and in the online
repository of FIXM Change Requests from the FIXM Work Area. This
document rather focuses on how to use the various FIXM components and
data structures.

Document terms
--------------

This is a guidance document describing recommended practices related to
the use and implementation of FIXM. It has been subject to FIXM CCB
review and endorsement and is therefore the official recommendation of
the FIXM CCB.

This document is however non-normative and requirements described in it
shall be considered mandatory only for those aiming to comply with this
guidance.

The use of the word "SHALL" or "REQUIRED" indicates an absolute
requirement of this guidance, i.e. a requirement to be strictly followed
in order to conform to this document.

The use of the word "SHOULD" or "RECOMMENDED" indicates that there may
exist valid reasons, in particular circumstances, to ignore a particular
aspect of the guidance.

How to improve this document
----------------------------

The FIXM implementation guidance evolves based on the feedback of the
FIXM users. Improvement proposals, such as new content or corrections,
can be posted at any time to the FIXM Work Area \[6\], using the FIXM
Community discussion forum. Improvement proposals can also be sent by
email to the FIXM CCB (<FIXM.CCB@eurocontrol.int>) or alternatively to
the FIXM Secretariat (<fixm.secretariat@eurocontrol.int>).

General Guidance on FIXM implementation
=======================================

Target audience
---------------

This chapter provides general guidance for understanding the main FIXM
components, outlines general requirements for valid FIXM core and FIXM
extensions usage and describes the general rules (encoding rules, data
plausibility rules, rules for absent data…) that are always applicable
whatever the implementation context. It therefore targets all FIXM
implementers.

Understanding FIXM Core, the Application Libraries and the Extensions
---------------------------------------------------------------------

### FIXM Core

#### What is it?

**FIXM Core** provides globally harmonized flight data structures that
can be exchanged in various contexts. The main context of use of **FIXM
Core** is ICAO FF-ICE. Therefore, **FIXM Core** currently captures the
flight data structures that are identified in the ICAO FF-ICE
Implementation Guidance Manual. Only flight data structures that are
globally applicable qualify for FIXM Core. Flight data structures that
are local or regional in nature do not qualify for **FIXM Core**. An
**Extensions** mechanism is implemented so that **FIXM Core** can be
extended in order to cover these local or regional data structures, as
appropriate.

**FIXM Core** exists as a standard for exchanging flight data rather
than as a set of pre-defined messages, allowing flexible exchanges
between users rather than enforcing rigid communication patterns.
However, once a given exchange is well-defined, it is useful to be able
to enforce syntax and content validation checks to ensure the data being
exchanged is of high quality. This is addressed by **Application
Libraries**.

#### What is a valid FIXM Core usage?

The general requirements for a valid **FIXM Core** usage are the
following:

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th><strong>REQUIREMENT ON DATA STRUCTURE</strong></th>
<th></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>Requirement</strong></td>
<td>To qualify as valid usage of FIXM Core, the flight-related content of a given message, or relevant part thereof, shall be syntactically valid against the FIXM Core XML Schemas.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>Rationale</strong></td>
<td>The basic valid usage of FIXM Core implies that the flight-related content of a message exchanged between two parties is valid against the FIXM Core XML Schemas. If a message includes additional information not in scope of FIXM Core, it must be structured so that its relevant part is valid against the FIXM Core XML Schemas.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>Important note</strong></td>
<td>Being syntactically valid against the FIXM Core XML Schemas implies the FIXM Core hierarchy is respected. FIXM Core is not expected to be used only as a library of flight datatypes.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>How to check this</strong></td>
<td>The content of a message, or relevant part thereof, validates without error against the FIXM Core XML schemas when tested / parsed by XML validation tools.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Example of FIXM core usage satisfying the requirement on data structure

> <img src="media/image2.png" style="width:0.26042in;height:0.26042in" />&lt;fx:aerodrome&gt;
>
> &lt;fb:locationIndicator&gt;EBBR&lt;/fb:locationIndicator&gt;
>
> &lt;/fx:aerodrome&gt;

This example displays an aerodrome reference involving a four-letter
ICAO location indicator. It complies with the structural rules for
aerodrome references defined by the FIXM Core XML schemas.

Examples of FIXM core usage **NOT** satisfying the requirement on data
structure

> <img src="media/image3.png" style="width:0.25in;height:0.25in" />&lt;fx:aerodrome&gt;
>
> &lt;fb:locationIndicator&gt;BRU&lt;/fb:locationIndicator&gt;
>
> &lt;/fx:aerodrome&gt;

This example displays an aerodrome reference based on property
locationIndicator. The value “BRU” does not respect the pattern
\[A-Z\]{4} enforced by FIXM for property locationIndicator. This example
does NOT comply with the structural rules for aerodrome references
defined by the FIXM XML schemas and does not qualify as valid FIXM
usage.

> --&gt;

This example features a valid XML schema that defines a Flight
Identification structure comprising the departure & arrival aerodrome
references, the aircraft identification and the estimated off-block
time. It also features an example XML sample that is valid against this
schema.

The example schema above is not FIXM Core and is not a FIXM extension.
It is a fictitious, standalone XML schema that defines its own hierarchy
of elements, but which reuses types from the core FIXM XML schemas for
typing these elements. The reuse of FIXM datatypes is highlighted in
blue in the schema description.

This example illustrates the reuse of FIXM Core as a library of
datatypes. While this practice is technically feasible and produces
valid schemas, it is not considered a valid FIXM Core usage in so far as
it breaks the hierarchy of properties defined by FIXM Core. An
information service relying on such an implementation practice would
fail to satisfy the FIXM Core requirement on data structure.

This example shows the FIXM encoding of vertical range \[FL240;FL250\].
It satisfies the basic data plausibility/correctness rule “*The
lowerBound shall always be lower than the upperBound*” that is
identified in Chapter 2.4.13. It qualifies as valid FIXM core usage.

This example represents a description of a fictitious formation of
military aircraft composed of two Mirages 2000 and one Rafale which
altogether constitute a single (formation) flight. This example is valid
from a data structure point of view (it validates against the FIXM core
XML schemas) but is not correct in so far as the sum of all
AircraftType.numberOfAircraft properties does not match
Aircraft.formationCount, which breaks a rule from Chapter 2.4.13. This
example does not qualify as valid FIXM core usage.

### Application Libraries

#### What is it?

An **Application Library** is a FIXM component that addresses the use of
FIXM Core in a given context. It can be of global, regional or local
applicability, depending on the context. An **Application Library**
essentially provides context-specific **‘message data structures’** and
**‘message templates’** which enables harmonized representation of the
FIXM-based messages exchanged using SWIM information services, as
outlined in the figure below.

<img src="media/image4.png" style="width:2.81504in;height:3.56522in" />

<span id="_Toc40797551" class="anchor"></span>Figure : General structure
of a message and role of an Application Library

<img src="media/image5.png" style="width:1.66806in;height:2.1125in" />An
**Application Library** has by design a loose dependency on FIXM Core.
It reuses and restricts relevant subsets of the FIXM Core data
structures.

An **Application Library** may also leverage **Extensions**, as
illustrated on the picture opposite.

An example of Application Library is the **FF-ICE Application Library**
developed and released by the FIXM CCB. This library addresses the use
of FIXM core in the specific context of FF-ICE. It provides harmonized
FF-ICE Message data structure (e.g. data structures for representing the
FF-ICE Filing Status, the FF-ICE Planning Status etc.) and the FF-ICE
message templates (e.g. the template for the FF-ICE Filed Flight Plan
Message, the template for the FF-ICE Flight Cancellation Message etc.),
in line with the FF-ICE Implementation Guidance Manual.

More details about this FF-ICE Application Library can be found in
Chapter 0.

#### Message Data Structures

Message Data structures designates at high level the data structures
that are necessary for understanding the meaning and purpose of the
information that is exchanged in a given context. They commonly include
message identifiers and timestamps, codes identifying business types of
messages, and any context-specific data that qualify the associated
message interactions.

Examples of message data structures can be found in the FF-ICE
Implementation Guidance Manual. The Figure below shows the message data
structures associated with the FF-ICE Flight Cancellation Message.

<img src="media/image6.png" style="width:2.36522in;height:3.62891in" />

<span id="_Toc40797552" class="anchor"></span>Figure : Example of
Message Data structures from FF-ICE

#### Message Templates

A message template is a more restrictive subset of message and flight
data structures that is relevant to a given information exchange. In
SWIM terms, a message template provides guidance for formatting a given
information service payload.

By pruning unused fields, adjusting cardinalities, and adding or further
limiting pattern constraints, a template can tailor the broad standard
represented by FIXM to reflect the content requirements of a particular
message exchange. Templates offer message-specific guidance and
validation rules while remaining entirely compliant with the broader
FIXM structures.

A list of benefits for employing templates is detailed below.

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th><strong>Without templates</strong></th>
<th><strong>With templates</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Increased development overhead as each user must independently interpret how message content requirements should be represented in FIXM format.</td>
<td>Tailored schemas reduce development overhead by providing additional guidance for creating messages with a FIXM-based content.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Individual interpretations of requirements could lead to inconsistent message content implementation across users.</td>
<td>Making dedicated implementation templates available to all users should improve implementation consistency.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>XML-based validation limited to data syntax checking with no guidance for required vs. optional but allowed vs. not allowed content (failing to fully leverage a major benefit of using XML).</td>
<td>XML-based validation enforces both syntax and content completeness rules (fully leveraging benefits of XML-based validation).</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

The use of message templates therefore improves interoperability, data
quality, and ease and cost of development for any exchange they are
applied to. They provide FIXM users with the guidance and structure they
desire while at the same time allowing FIXM to remain open and flexible.

**XML representation of FIXM-based Message Templates**

The XML representation of FIXM-based Message templates is currently
achieved by the FIXM CCB by restricting the main complex types defined
by FIXM. Restricting complex types is a standard-based approach for
removing unwanted elements and/or attributes and to apply tighter
restraints to cardinalities, patterns, facets. Complex type restrictions
also provide built-in validation: if the restriction is not correctly
formed in relation to the parent type then the resulting schemas will
not validate.

**Benefits of XSD restrictions**

-   XSD restrictions are explicit: using an XSD schema with restrictions
    means using the rules of the base XSD schema plus additional rules
    that are explicitly declared;

-   XSD restrictions provide some built-in validation for quality
    assurance

-   XSD restrictions represent a natural use of the XSD standard;

-   XSD restrictions deliver benefits in terms of model development and
    maintenance. [1]

**Potential shortcomings of XSD restrictions**

The online literature about XML schema design generally considers that
the restrictions of XSD complex types are the most difficult and
therefore the less supported part of the XML schema specification:

-   [W3C XML Schema Design Patterns: Avoiding
    Complexity](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/aa468564(v=msdn.10))

-   [XML Schema best
    practices](https://www.google.fr/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=3&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiDpbPNi7TiAhWL6qQKHap_BvIQFjACegQIBBAC&url=http%3A%2F%2Fxml.coverpages.org%2FHP-StephensonSchemaBestPractices.pdf&usg=AOvVaw1ABGdAqSrVz_Rrgbe0CxW9)

-   W3C Workshop on XML Schema 1.0 User Experiences, June 21-22, 2005

    -   <http://www.w3.org/2005/05/25-schema/wsi.pdf>

    -   <http://www.w3.org/2005/06/21-schema-workshop/chairs-report.html>

The statements made in the mid-2000’s about XSD restrictions are
expected to be equally true in 2020, considering that XML/XSD is no
longer a trendy technology, with alternatives such as JSON being
increasingly favoured.

XSD restrictions have been successfully tested by the FIXM CCB using
Oracle Java Architecture for XML Binding (JAXB). However, as of the
publication date of this document, they have not been tested by the FIXM
CCB using other marshalling tools, especially in non-Java environments.
It is therefore acknowledged that the choice of XSD restrictions might
create increased complexity on implementers, in particular at the time
of the marshalling/unmarshalling of the XSD templates using tools not
fully compatible with XSD restrictions.

Implementers experiencing issues with the templates provided by the FIXM
CCB within their development environment are invited to report about
their problems to the FIXM community, with details about the tools being
used. Alternative to XSD restrictions may be then considered, as
appropriate (see next chapter).

**XSD Profiles as a potential alternative to XSD Restrictions**

An XSD profile would represent a reduced, further restricted subset of
the original model. This approach is very similar to using restrictions
but accomplishes the task by directly creating smaller, parallel models
of the adjusted packages rather than producing them via a restriction.
The figure below illustrates at high-level the differences.

<img src="media/image7.png" style="width:3.47488in;height:2.38056in" />

<span id="_Toc40797553" class="anchor"></span>Figure : XSD Restriction
vs XSD Profile

XSD profiles would not restrict the types from the base reference and
would not bring any additional complexity. They could therefore be
processed by marshalling tools in a smoother way compared to XSD
restrictions.

XSD profiles may be therefore developed as an alternative to XSD
restrictions for representing FIXM-based message templates.

#### How to build an application library?

APPENDIX B provides detailed guidance for creating application
libraries.

### Extensions

#### What is it?

An extension designates a supplement to FIXM that supports additional
(commonly local or regional) requirements from a particular organisation
or community of interest. An extension may supplement FIXM Core by
defining additional flight data structures exchanged locally or
regionally, and/or may supplement an existing Application Library by
defining additional messaging data structure exchanged locally or
regionally.

#### What is a valid use of an extension?

A number of rules are established in order to ensure that extensions are
not developed as a replacement of FIXM Core or a subset thereof.

The requirements on FIXM extensions are provided below. They are equally
applicable to verified and non-verified extensions, but are enforceable
only for verified extension. Non-verified extensions satisfying the
requirements below will be recognised as a valid usage of the FIXM
extension mechanism.

**Requirement on extension design**

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th><strong>Requirement</strong></th>
<th>To qualify for a valid FIXM extension, an extension shall be designed in accordance with the modelling principles described in APPENDIX A.</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>Rationale</strong></td>
<td>The successful development of an extension, and its successful integration with the FIXM core packages, requires rules on extension design to be followed consistently by all implementers.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>How to check this</strong></td>
<td>Checking that an extension satisfies this requirement cannot be automated and requires manual analysis of the extension content by the FIXM community. As a general principle, extensions to FIXM core that are proposed for online publication on the FIXM web site should be checked against this requirement.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

**Requirement on extension content**

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th><strong>Requirement</strong></th>
<th>To qualify as a valid FIXM extension, an extension shall never contain a model element that would redefine, or supersede, a model element that is already defined in FIXM Core.</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>Rationale</strong></td>
<td>FIXM core is an information exchange model capturing flight information that is globally harmonised. Redefining or superseding the FIXM core content in an extension would amount to diverging from this globally harmonised content and would go against the fundamental harmonisation objectives of FF-ICE and FIXM.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>How to check this</strong></td>
<td>Checking that an extension satisfies this requirement cannot be automated and requires manual analysis of the extension content by the FIXM community. As a general principle, extensions to FIXM core that are proposed for online publication on the FIXM web site should be checked against this requirement.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

named “NasFlight” (in blue on the diagram) that extends the core model
element “Extension” and which defines a content that supplements the

mechanism.

model element “Flight” and loosens its format, allowing any type of
character string to be populated. This is an example of a FIXM extension
redefining content from FIXM Core. It does NOT qualify as valid usage of
the FIXM extension mechanism.

#### How to build an extension?

The FIXM extension mechanism distributes class-specific extension hooks
throughout the model that implementers can leverage to define their
specific data structures.

<img src="media/image10.emf" style="width:6.10435in;height:1.4087in" />

The key benefits of the approach are the following:

1.  ability to allow Extension validation,

2.  multiple co-existing Extensions,

3.  co-location of Extension data with the Core data it extends;

4.  ability to easily remove extensions and pare down the model.

This permissive approach enables FIXM users to enrich the core FIXM
datasets with as many information elements as necessary, as required by
the applicable implementation context.

APPENDIX A provides a rulebook and detailed guidance for creating
extensions.

#### Ignoring extension data 

Consumers of FIXM information may not need, and/or may not be able to
process and interpret extension data supplementing a core FIXM dataset.

Using XSLTs is an approach for removing unwanted Extension data (known
or unknown) from a FIXM XML dataset, as appropriate. An example of an
XSLT that removes all Extension content is provided below:

&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;  
&lt;xsl:stylesheet version="2.0"
xmlns:fb="http://www.fixm.aero/base/4.1"
xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform"&gt;  
&lt;xsl:output method="xml" version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"
indent="yes"/&gt;  
&lt;xsl:template match="@\*|node()"&gt;  
&lt;xsl:copy&gt;  
&lt;xsl:apply-templates select="@\*|node()"/&gt;  
&lt;/xsl:copy&gt;  
&lt;/xsl:template&gt;  
&lt;xsl:template match="fb:extension"/&gt;  
&lt;/xsl:stylesheet&gt;

Tested Development Environments
-------------------------------

*Ask FAA to share their findings with respect of which development
environments work properly with FIXM 4.2.0*

General encoding rules
----------------------

### Date/Time Specification

FIXM requires times to be expressed in UTC.

A constraint is placed on class *Base.Types.Time*, the class used to
represent all date/time values in FIXM, imposes the use of the trailing
character ‘z’ to indicate UTC, in line with the W3C XSD specification.

Example: 20th July 1969 at 20:18UTC is expressed as  
1969-07-20T20:18:00.000Z

**Note to implementers**

The mapping of the XSD type dateTime to native structures in various
development contexts is not always 1-1 and may exhibit a wide variety of
difficulties depending on the tooling and runtime context. In
particular, the trailing character ‘z’ indicating UTC may actually be
stripped/omitted, leading to FIXM times being interpreted as local times
instead of UTC times by some applications. FIXM implementers are
therefore invited to crosscheck that their systems correctly interpret
FIXM times as UTC time.

### Geographical positions

FIXM captures the concept of Geographical Position as defined by ICAO
Annex 15.

*Position (geographical). Set of coordinates (latitude and longitude)
referenced to the mathematical reference ellipsoid which define the
position of a point on the surface of the Earth.*

This model element maps to the ISO 19107 “Point” construct, defined as a
single location given by a direct position.

A geographic location consists of a co-ordinate reference system and
geographic co-ordinates.

Co-ordinate reference system

ICAO Annex 11 chapter 2.29.1 states that World Geodetic System — 1984
(WGS-84) shall be used as the horizontal (geodetic) reference system for
air navigation. The Coordinate Reference System reference is critical
for the correct encoding and processing of FIXM positions*. This is
because a CRS not only indicates the geodetic datum and ellipsoid for
which point coordinates are expressed but also the order of the
coordinate axes in which coordinate values are provided, e.g. latitude
before longitude – which is an important convention for the aviation
domain.* \[copied from [OGC
12-028r1](https://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=62061)\]
The EPSG:4326 CRS is the recommended choice for AIXM 5.1 data sets that
use the WGS-84 reference datum.

FIXM implements a fixed co-ordinate reference system:
“urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::4326”.

Geographic co-ordinates

The EPSG:4326 CRS has latitude as the primary axis, which indicates that
**the order of the values in the fb:pos element is** **first latitude**,
**second longitude**. This ordering convention is the one applied to the
aviation domain.

The co-ordinates are represented in FIXM by a two-valued sequence[2],
the first being the latitude and the second being the longitude, each of
which is a floating point number (the decimal value in degrees). The
direction is determined by the sign of the value, as specified in the
next table.

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Sign</th>
<th>Latitude</th>
<th>Longitude</th>
</tr>
</thead>

<td>Positive</td>
<td>N</td>
<td>E</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Negative</td>
<td>S</td>
<td>W</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Note the latitude and longitude values are encoded as double in FIXM.
Imposition of range restriction (-90≤latitude≤90, -180≤longitude≤180)
does not appear in the model since different elements of the sequence of
values have different constraints.

Examples

<img src="media/image2.png" style="width:0.26042in;height:0.26042in" />

<img src="media/image2.png" style="width:0.26042in;height:0.26042in" />

On EXAMPLE 1 above, number ‘59.0’ represents the latitude and number
‘-30.0’ represents the longitude.

Miscellaneous

The W3C XML schema 1.0 specification defines three special values for
float/double: positive infinity, negative infinity and not-a-number. In
this context, a “pos” element expressed as &lt;fb:pos&gt;INF
-INF&lt;/fb:pos&gt; or &lt;fb:pos&gt;NaN NaN&lt;/fb:pos&gt; would be
syntactically correct; it would validate against the core FIXM XML
schemas. However, it would not represent any plausible location. The use
of these special values is therefore not accepted when exchanging
geographical positions in FIXM.

Why FIXM does not use the Geography Markup Language (GML)

FIXM does not adopt the GML standard for the representation of
geospatial data. The reasons for not adopting GML are the following:

-   Wherever a GML dependency is introduced, there would be a need for
    users to use the GML schemas and therefore to understand GML, which
    increases implementation costs.

-   The Flight Planning community is not traditionally familiar with
    geospatial concepts. The introduction of GML would become an
    important drawback for FIXM adoption in support of FF-ICE/1.

-   Introducing a dependency on GML would make FIXM more difficult to
    implement particularly in certain environments. For instance, .NET
    technologies have been identified as *incompatible* with the GML
    usage.

### References to published aeronautical information

Describing the predicted movement of the flight commonly means
indicating which parts of the infrastructure (ATS routes, waypoints,
radio navigation aids etc.) are expected to be used by the flight. This
is enabled in FIXM by a set of “references” constructs. These references
are not flight-specific information; they pertain to the aeronautical
information domain.

Different formats exist for exchanging aeronautical information, whose
usages depend on specific implementation considerations and actual
context within the overall data chain. For instance:

-   AIXM is developed in order to enable the provision in digital format
    of the aeronautical information that is in the scope of Aeronautical
    Information Services (AIS). AIXM 5.1 covers both the content of
    Aeronautical Information Publications (AIP) and of the NOTAM
    information.

-   The ARINC 424 standard defines a format for navigation (and
    communication) information, including but not limited to, aerodrome,
    runway, navaid, airway and terminal approach procedure information
    that is exchanged between data suppliers and avionics vendors.

-   The Aerodrome Mapping Exchange Schema (AMXM XML Schema) is an
    exchange format specification for AMDB as standardized by and
    dedicated to the EUROCAE/RTCA Aeronautical Databases WG44/SC217. It
    is an XML Schema implementation of the DO-291C/ED-119C AMXM UML
    model.

**FIXM does not import any of these formats or profile thereof.** FIXM
defines its own structures for referring to aeronautical information
that are **self-contained** but mappable to their AIXM/AMXM… equivalents
thanks to the reuse of a common semantics. FIXM also provides an
**optional** mechanism enabling these self-contained references to be
supplemented with, but not replaced by, **hypertext** **references** to
AIXM features.

The following chapters provide guidance for correctly encoding these
references in FIXM.

#### Generic hypertext references

If an AIXM 5.1 feature exists that corresponds to the element being
referred to, an **optional** hypertext reference to that AIXM feature
may be provided. This reference shall be expressed in accordance with
chapter 3.4.1 (*Abstract references using UUID*) of the [AIXM feature
Identification and
Reference](http://www.aixm.aero/sites/aixm.aero/files/imce/AIXM51/aixm_feature_identification_and_reference-1.0.pdf)
document developed by the AIXM community.

This hypertext reference may be used - or ignored - by the receiving
system depending on its capabilities.

Example:

> &lt;fx:*\[FIXMelement\]*
> href="urn:uuid:81e47548-9f00-4970-b641-8ff8f99098a5"&gt;

Important note: FIXM does not import the W3C XML Linking Language
(xlink) v1.1 schemas in order to represent the hypertext references.
FIXM mimics the xlink Locator attribute named “href” but defines it
within the FIXM (Base) namespace. This design is intentional and aims to
avoid potential issues or difficulties when marshalling / unmarshalling
the standard xlink:href attribute.

#### References to Waypoints

OPTION 1 - Minimum reference

As a minimum, the coded designator of waypoint shall be provided, as
published in the AIPs.

OPTION 2 - Unambiguous reference

*(OPTION 2 = OPTION 1 + supplementary position information)*

The coded designator of a waypoint is not always sufficient for
unambiguously referring to that element. The 5-letter coded designator
of a waypoint is supposed to be unique world-wide (according to ICAO
Annex 11) but is not in reality. There are at least 5%
duplicates/triplicates/even more…

FIXM adds an optional property 'position' which may be used as a
complement to the 'designator' information in order to remove any
ambiguity on the designator.

Important note: the combinations of fields \[designator + position\]
shall not be interpreted as a natural key uniquely identifying the
waypoint, in so far as producing and consuming systems/services may use
different aeronautical information sources with different degree of
precisions for lat/long, leading to small variations of the position
information. The supplementary fields shall be used for disambiguation
purposes only (i.e. plausibility checks based on position) in case of
duplicate/triplicate/…

OPTION 3 - Minimum reference with supplementary AIXM pointer

*(OPTION 3 = OPTION 1 + supplementary hypertext reference)*

Option 3 corresponds to Option 1 with an additional hypertext reference
as described in chapter Generic hypertext references.

OPTION 4 - Complete reference

*(OPTION 4 = OPTION 2 + OPTION 3)*

Option 4 corresponds to the combination of Option 2 and Option 3. See
explanations above.

Note about the pattern constraint for waypoint designators

FIXM supports waypoint designators of 1 to 5 characters. This design is
intentional. In most cases, waypoints have a 5-letter designator, as
prescribed by ICAO. However, these designators might be shorter in some
particular cases. Examples of shorter waypoint designators could be
found in various sources:

-   In chapter 7 of the ARINC 424 specification. This chapter provides
    rules for forming the designators of waypoints in the absence of
    published designators. These rules can lead to designators of less
    than 5 characters. The following extracts from ARINC 424-19 provide
    some examples, which are highlighted in blue.

-   In the [US FAA’s publication of Instrument Flight Procedures
    encodings in ARINC 424-18
    format](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/flight_info/aeronav/digital_products/cifp/download/).

OPTION 1 - Minimum reference

As a minimum, the coded designator of a navaid shall be provided, as
published in the AIPs.

OPTION 2 - Unambiguous reference

*(OPTION 2 = OPTION 1 + supplementary position & navaidServicetype
information)*

The coded designator of a navaid is not always sufficient for
unambiguously referring to that element. The en-route navaids (VOR, DME,
NDB) designator is supposed to be unique (according to ICAO Annex 11)
within 600 NM. This means that these designators are not unique
world-wide. For airport navaids, there is no limitation.

FIXM adds two optional properties 'position' and 'navaidServiceType'
which may be used as a complement to the 'designator' information in
order to remove any ambiguity on the designator.

Important note: the combination of fields \[designator + position +
navaid service type\] shall not be interpreted as a natural key uniquely
identifying the navaid, in so far as producing and consuming
systems/services may use different aeronautical information sources with
different degree of precisions for lat/long, leading to small variations
of the position information. The supplementary fields shall be used for
disambiguation purposes only (i.e. plausibility checks based on position
and navaid service type) in case of duplicate/triplicate/…

OPTION 3 - Minimum reference with supplementary AIXM pointer

*(OPTION 3 = OPTION 1 + supplementary hypertext reference)*

Option 3 corresponds to Option 1 with an additional hypertext reference
as described in chapter Generic hypertext references.

OPTION 4 - Complete reference

*(OPTION 4 = OPTION 2 + OPTION 3)*

Option 4 corresponds to the combination of Option 2 and Option 3. See
explanations above.

DME “BOR” that is ‘published’ in AIXM 5.1 as part of the fictitious

Important note: FIXM enables the encoding of richer aerodrome
“reference” structures, such as

> &lt;fx:destinationAerodrome
> href="urn:uuid:1b54b2d6-a5ff-4e57-94c2-f4047a381c64"&gt;
>
> &lt;fb:iataDesignator&gt;DLN&lt;/fb:iataDesignator&gt;
>
> &lt;fb:locationIndicator&gt;EADD&lt;/fb:locationIndicator&gt;
>
> &lt;fb:name&gt;DONLON&lt;/fb:name&gt;
>
> &lt;fb:referencePoint srsName="urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::4326"&gt;
>
> &lt;fb:pos&gt;52.3716666666667 -31.9494444444444&lt;/fb:pos&gt;
>
> &lt;/fb:referencePoint&gt;
>
> &lt;/fx:destinationAerodrome&gt;

The provision of the name and reference point in addition to the
location indicator is technically possible but does not serve the
purpose of identifying the aerodrome. This implementation practice only
aims to provide consumers with richer information about the aerodrome
being referred to. Whether or not to use this supplementary information
is at the discretion of the consuming system / service.

are not unique. However, the systematic pairing of an ATS route
designator with a route point (i.e. a significant point belonging to
that ATS route) in FIXM is considered sufficient for enabling
unambiguous identification of the ATS Route being referred to.

OPTION 2 - Minimum reference with supplementary AIXM pointer

FIXM also supports the supplementary provision of the abbreviated
designator of the SID or the STAR which is commonly used in FMS
databases and in some ground automation systems. The ‘abbreviated
designator’, if provided, should be the designator obtained after
applying the rules for shortening names specified by the ARINC 424
specification, chapter 7.4. Example:

A relative point is a bearing and distance from a reference navaid.
Encoding a relative point in FIXM requires the ‘bearing’, ‘distance’ and
‘referencePoint’ properties to be provided. All of these properties
shall be provided.

FIXM enables a relative point to be supplemented with an optional
‘position’ value for storing the actual position of the relative point
if already known. The exchange of this information may prove useful in
order to save consuming systems / services from (re)computing the
position of the relative point. Whether or not to use this supplementary
information is at the discretion of the consuming system / service.

### Vertical distances

**Definitions**

The term vertical distance collectively refers to altitudes, elevations
and heights, as defined by
ICAO<img src="media/image22.emf" style="width:6.26806in;height:2.97774in" />

<span id="_Toc40797556" class="anchor"></span>Figure : Differences
between Elevation, Altitude, Height and Ellipsoid height

-   **Altitude** = The vertical distance of a level, a point or an
    object considered as a point, measured from mean sea level (MSL).
    **\[ICAO\]**

-   **Elevation** = The vertical distance of a point or a level, on or
    affixed to the surface of the earth, measured from mean sea level.
    **\[ICAO\]**

-   **Height** = The vertical distance of a level, a point or an object
    considered as a point, measured from a specified datum. **\[ICAO\]**

-   **Ellipsoid height** = The height related to the reference
    ellipsoid, measured along the ellipsoidal outer normal through the
    point in question. **\[ICAO\]**

**FIXM representation of vertical distances**

FIXM supports the representation of altitudes expressed in feet or
meters (FIXM construct ‘Altitude’), of altitudes expressed as flight
level number or standard metric level (FIXM construct ‘FlightLevel’) and
of ellipsoid heights & heights SFC expressed in feet or meter (FIXM
construct ‘Height’ used in conjunction with a VerticalReference).

<img src="media/image23.png" style="width:5.97761in;height:4.0142in" />

These vertical distances are specialisations of the generic class
Measure which serves as the parent class for all measure types including
speeds, angles, pressures, temperatures etc. Therefore, altitudes,
flight levels and heights are always encoded as double values, although
integer values are expected. “Double Integer” conversion can be handled
differently depending on the technical context. This may lead to e.g.
flight level value 100 being expressed as 100.00…0001 and the flight
level value 101 being expressed as 100.99…99999. It is acknowledged that
the current FIXM design may create value persistence problem across
applications, in particular if rounding or truncation are applied
further down. FIXM implementers are therefore invited to verify the
persistence of vertical distances values across their software.

**Examples**

The following examples show valid FIXM encoding of altitudes and flight
levels expressed as integer.

> &lt;fb:altitude uom="FT"&gt;10000&lt;/fb:altitude&gt;
>
> &lt;fb:altitude uom="M"&gt;3500&lt;/fb:altitude&gt;
>
> &lt;fb:flightLevel uom="FL"&gt;290&lt;/fb:flightLevel&gt;
>
> &lt;fb:flightLevel uom="SM"&gt;1130&lt;/fb:flightLevel&gt;

The following example shows the encoding of a flight level expressed as
a double. This encoding is technically permitted by FIXM but is NOT
recommended.

> &lt;fb:flightLevel uom="FL"&gt;290.0&lt;/fb:flightLevel&gt;

### Sequence numbers

The FIXM Logical Model specifies several ordered repeating sequences.
The FIXM XML schemas add an optional sequence number attribute to the
repeating elements in order to ensure that the order of a sequence is
always preserved, even after XSLT manipulation.

The sequence number should be a sequentially increasing integer with a
value beginning at zero.

Example

<img src="media/image2.png" style="width:0.42708in;height:0.42708in" />

### Contact Information

<img src="media/image24.png" style="width:4.4438in;height:4.42945in" />

<u>Postal Address</u>

TODO

<u>Telephone Contact</u>

TODO

<u>Online Contact</u>

In FIXM, the online contact information can include an email address
and/or a network address.

A network address is always formed of two pieces of information: the
**linkage** and the **network** information.

-   The former captures the expression of the network address. This is
    supported by property OnlineContact.linkage.

-   The latter captures the network on which the address is valid. This
    is supported by property OnlineContact.network.

Property OnlineContact.network provides a choice between predefined
network types and free text. Network information should be preferably
encoded using the property NetworkChoice.**type** populated with the
applicable enumerated value from enumeration TelecomNetworkType. If none
of the enumerated values is suitable, the property NetworkChoice.other
shall be used. The ATM Information Reference Model provides additional
telecom network types that should be used for populating
NetworkChoice.other, as appropriate. These additional AIRM values are
available at the following link:

<http://airm.aero/viewer/1.0.0/logical-model.html#CodeTelecomNetworkType>

The type of network affects the format of the linkage information.

-   When the network is INTERNET, the linkage should be a resolvable URL

-   When the network is AFTN, the linkage should be a valid AFTN address

Examples

The following example illustrates contact information formed of an email
address and an Internet address expressed as a resolvable URL.

> &lt;fb:onlineContact&gt;
>
> &lt;fb:email&gt;fixm.secretariat@eurocontrol.int&lt;/fb:email&gt;
>
> &lt;fb:linkage&gt;https://www.fixm.aero/content/contact.pl&lt;/fb:linkage&gt;
>
> &lt;fb:network&gt;
>
> &lt;fb:type&gt;INTERNET&lt;/fb:type&gt;
>
> &lt;/fb:network&gt;
>
> &lt;/fb:onlineContact&gt;

The following example illustrates contact information formed of an AFTN
address. The example features the EUROCONTROL NM ‘AFTN address’ for
Flight Plan Message Submission to IFPS (FP1 - Brussels (Haren)).

> &lt;fb:onlineContact&gt;
>
> &lt;fb:linkage&gt;EUCHZMFP&lt;/fb:linkage&gt;
>
> &lt;fb:network&gt;
>
> &lt;fb:type&gt;AFTN&lt;/fb:type&gt;
>

The following example illustrates contact information formed of a SITA
address. ‘SITA’ is not a value captured in FIXM enumeration
TelecomNetworkType but is part of the reference ATM vocabulary provided
by the AIRM ([AIRM codelist
CodeTelecomNetworkType](http://airm.aero/viewer/1.0.0/logical-model.html#CodeTelecomNetworkType)).
The example features the EUROCONTROL NM ‘SITA address’ for Flight Plan
Message Submission to IFPS (FP1 - Brussels (Haren)).

### Rules for absent data

FIXM supports the representation of fields that are explicitly absent or
that are deleted. It does so by leveraging the XSD specification for
Elements which includes the *nillable* attribute. This “nillable”
attribute specifies whether an explicit null value can be assigned to
the element. When nillable is set to “true” in the element definition,
this in turn enables an instance of the element to have the built-in nil
attribute with a value set to “true”. Example:

> &lt;xs:complexType name="FlightType"&gt;  
> \[...\]  
> &lt;xs:element name="dangerousGoods" type="fx:DangerousGoodsType"
> **nillable="true"** \[...\]&gt;  
> \[...\]  
> &lt;/xs:complexType&gt;
>
> &lt;fx:Flight&gt;  
> &lt;fx:dangerousGoods **xsi:nil="true"**/&gt;  
> &lt;/fx:Flight&gt;

FIXM does not support the exchange of a “nil reason” to explain why an
element is nil. The interpretation of a nil element therefore depends on
the context of the information exchange:

-   A nil element included in an FF-ICE Flight Plan Update message will
    indicate that this flight plan data item is to be deleted. This
    interpretation is dictated by the FF-ICE Implementation Guidance
    Manual which states the following:

> *7.4.3.6 A Flight Plan Update is only required to contain those items
> that have changed (in addition to the mandatory items specified for an
> Update message), i.e. it is not necessary to resend complete flight
> data. Data items that were included in the previous version of the
> flight plan and have not been included in the Flight Plan Update will
> remain unchanged. This means that a mechanism is required to identify
> when a flight plan data item is to be deleted.”*

-   A nil element included in an FF-ICE Flight Data Response Message
    will indicate that the data item is explicitly declared as not
    available to the flight data requestor.

Future FIXM versions may support the exchange of an additional “nil
reason” attribute, if the need for it is identified by the FIXM
Community.

*Note: the support for nillable elements has implied a significant
design change in FIXM Core 4.2.0. The previous FIXM Core versions relied
extensively on XSD attributes, which are not nillable. These XSD
attributes were converted to XSD elements in FIXM Core 4.2.0 so that the
built-in XSD attribute nillable could be leveraged.*

##### Declaring null Measures and Geographical Position

The FIXM Measures types enforce the provision of the “uom” attribute
together with the numeric value of the measure. Likewise, the FIXM
Geographical Position type enforces the provision of the srsName
attribute “urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::4326” together with the position. This
design guarantees that the required unit of measure and coordinate
reference system are always provided in order to enable the correct
interpretation of measures and positions. However, it requires a special
workaround when null values are to be exchanged.

The provision of a null value for a measure or a position still requires
the mandatory attribute “uom” or “srsName” to be provided, even if
meaningless. For instance, the following XML data would NOT validate
against the FIXM Core schema, because the uom for a Mass is missing.

<img src="media/image25.png" style="width:0.23403in;height:0.23403in" />&lt;fx:desired&gt;

&lt;fx:takeoffMass xsi:nil="true/"&gt;

&lt;/fx:desired&gt;

Therefore, the following rules apply when declaring null Measures or
Geographical Position.

When a measure is to be declared null,

-   Information provider side: Provide a fake uom in order to ensure
    proper schema validation

-   Information consumer side: Ignore the fake uom provided together
    with the null measure

When a geographical position is to be declared null:

-   Information provider side: Provide the srsName
    “urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::4326” in order to ensure proper schema
    validation

-   Information consumer side: Ignore the provided srsName provided
    together with the null position.

Example of valid null measure declaration with a fake uom to be ignored:

> <img src="media/image26.png" style="width:0.26389in;height:0.26389in" />&lt;fx:desired&gt;
>
> &lt;fx:takeoffMass xsi:nil="true" uom="KG"/&gt;
>
> &lt;/fx:desired&gt;

### The use of other exchange models

*An information exchange model is designed to enable the sharing of
information in a digital format within a specific domain*[3] (e.g. AIXM
for the aeronautical information domain or FIXM for the flight
information domain). However, some ATM operations may require ATM
information to be treated and exchanged in a more interrelated way. For
example, a single traffic flow management message may include both
airspace geometries (aeronautical information domain) as well as
information about the flights passing through them (flight information
domain).

Satisfying these cross-cutting information needs can be done in
different manners. Combining data from existing information exchange
models (e.g. AIXM and FIXM) is one approach. This document briefly
touches on two possible options for doing so in an attempt to aid FIXM
users wishing to create multi-model data exchanges.

#### Correlation references

The first option to consider is breaking down a multi-model data
transmission into separate messages for each involved exchange model.
These messages are supplemented with correlation references to all other
component messages of the overall multi-model transmission. Supplying a
list of unique message identifiers for each entry in the message group
should be sufficient. This lets an end user know that such a message
should not be processed alone and which other messages are intended to
accompany it. Message identifiers and references can likely be handled
by the data exchange’s messaging layer without the need to modify the
exchange models themselves to accommodate this approach. However, the
end user must perform the correlation work themselves. This would
include creating procedures for how to handle a situation where only a
subset of a message group is received.

#### Correlation models

The second option to consider is creating a new model that provides
direct references within itself to the required exchange models – thus
allowing multiple models to be used together in a single data
transmission. This approach frees end users from the burden of
correlating messages (and the associated dangers of partial data loss).
However, this approach cannot be as easily leveraged by systems already
capable of handling the underlying exchange models used. The new model
must first be created and incorporated into the systems that transmit
and receive this data.

Using FIXM in Support of FF-ICE
===============================

Target audience
---------------

This chapter provides specific guidance in support of the implementation
of FF-ICE using FIXM. It therefore targets FF-ICE Implementers.

The FF-ICE Application Library for FIXM
---------------------------------------

The FF-ICE Application Library is an Application Library[4] for FIXM
that addresses the specific use of FIXM Core in the context of ICAO
FF-ICE. It provides harmonized FF-ICE Message data structures and the
individual FF-ICE Message templates in line with the requirements on
FF-ICE Messages defined by the ICAO FF-ICE Implementation Guidance
Manual (ICAO Doc 9965 Volume II).

The content of the FF-ICE Application Library is the following:

> <img src="media/image27.png" style="width:3.28125in;height:4.80911in" />
> <img src="media/image28.png" style="width:2.55556in;height:2.4821in" />

<span id="_Toc40797557" class="anchor"></span>Figure : Overview of the
FF-ICE Message Application Library content

The FF-ICE Message Application Library is developed and published by the
FIXM CCB, together with FIXM Core.

*  
*

### FF-ICE Message data structures

The FF-ICE message data structures are the data elements that
specifically qualify the FF-ICE Messages. They do not describe a Flight
but are necessary for understanding the purpose and meaning of an FF-ICE
information exchange. The FF-ICE message data modelled by the FF-ICE
Application Library include:

-   A model element representing generically an FF-ICE Message with its
    identifier, timestamp, type etc. An enumeration provides the
    possible types of FF-ICE Messages: Filed Flight Plan message,
    Submission Response message, Filing Status message etc.

-   Model elements representing the different FF-ICE statuses with their
    possible values: Planning statuses CONCUR / NON\_CONCUR / NEGOTIATE,
    Filing statuses ACCEPTABLE / NOT\_ACCEPTABLE, Submission statuses
    ACK / MANUAL / REJECT etc.

-   Model elements representing the FF-ICE participants and their
    properties, which are used for identifying the operational
    stakeholders sending and receiving FF-ICE messages, or the list of
    relevant ASPs etc.

The FF-ICE Message data structures are traceable to the FF-ICE
Implementation Guidance Manual Appendix B. For instance:

<img src="media/image29.png" style="width:6.28125in;height:2.09225in" />

> <span id="_Toc40797558" class="anchor"></span>Figure : Example of
> FF-ICE Message data structures tracing to the FF-ICE Implementation
> Guidance Manual, Appendix B

The FF-ICE message data structures other than Choices and Codelists are
extendable. This enables implementers to accommodate additional FF-ICE
message data structures required locally or regionally, in support of
local or regional FF-ICE requirements. Extension hooks are defined in a
similar fashion as for FIXM Core data structures.

The picture below provides an overview of the FF-ICE Message data
structures modelled in the FF-ICE Application Library.

FF-ICE Message Templates
------------------------

### Overview 

The FF-ICE Message templates are the representations of the individual
FF-ICE messages that are exchanged by the FF-ICE Services. Thirteen
message templates are defined in the FF-ICE Application library v1.0.0.
They correspond to the thirteen FF-ICE Messages described in the
FF-ICE/R1 Implementation Guidance Manual, Appendix C. The following
table provides the correspondence between the FF-ICE message templates
from the library and their corresponding description in the FF-ICE
Implementation Guidance Manual, Appendix C.

The FF-ICE Message templates define concretely the restricted subsets of
the FF-ICE Message data elements of the FIXM Core flight elements that
are relevant for each FF-ICE message transaction. They explicitly
declare which elements are mandatory, optional or irrelevant in each
case, and enforce stricter content patterns as appropriate.

### Example of the FF-ICE ‘Flight Cancellation’ Message

The following table is a simplified version of table C-8 from the FF-ICE
Implementation Guidance Manual, Appendix C. It describes the content of
the FF-ICE Flight Cancellation Message and indicates which fields are
mandatory (highlighted **in bold** in this document) or optional
(highlighted in *in italic*).

The FF-ICE Application library translates this table into an
implementable message template. This is illustrated by the picture
below. The message template resulting from the translation of this table
is displayed with a blue background.

<span id="_Toc40797560" class="anchor"></span>Figure : The FF-ICE Flight
Cancellation Message Template

<img src="media/image32.png" style="width:3.21736in;height:3.35069in" />**Explanations**

**XSD complex type restrictions** are used to pare down the Flight and
the FF-ICE Message data structures to just those fields that are
applicable to the Flight Cancellation Message, as well as to enforce
stricter optionality and content patterns where appropriate.

The XSD complex type restrictions are implemented by creating a new
class that generalizes the class to be restricted and then applying the
&lt;&lt;XSDrestriction&gt;&gt; stereotype to the generalization
connector, as shown in brown on the picture opposite.

<img src="media/image33.png" style="width:3.70486in;height:2.49722in" />

XML elements being irrelevant in the context of the message template are
eliminated by removing them from the model, as shown in red on the
picture opposite. Elements being mandatory in the context of the message
template have their cardinality set to (at least) 1 in the restriction,
as shown in blue.

<img src="media/image34.png" style="width:1.82708in;height:1.06042in" />In
general, all optionality, cardinality, and pattern restrictions are
implemented by applying the desired changes to the restricted class.

Because XSD complex type restrictions must use the same namespace as the
types they restrict, it is necessary to change their names. The
convention used in the FF-ICE Application Library is to prepend each
restricted class with “Ffice” plus an initialism of the message being
modeled – hence **FficeFC** for the FF-ICE **<u>F</u>**light
**<u>C</u>**ancellation Message.

Restricted classes require the restricted versions of associated
sub-classes. XSD complex type restrictions are therefore linked together
to form an entire restricted message. This provides clear guidance on
how the FF-ICE message template is constructed.

FF-ICE/1 Services Description Example
-------------------------------------

The purpose of this chapter is to provide examples of service
descriptions to realize the FF-ICE/1 services[5] exchanging FIXM flight
plans.

### Role of FIXM in support of FF-ICE

As described in section XXX FIXM 4.2.0 introduces the FF-ICE Application
Library, a new component including a series of XML Schema templates that
support the encoding of the messages identified by FF-ICE/1. While these
structures are an essential building block for realizing the FF-ICE
information exchanges, fully materializing the FF-ICE information
exchanges requires further descriptions of FF-ICE/1 Services that
exchange FIXM-based FF-ICE/1 messages.

FF-ICE/1 Service implementation considerations are strictly speaking
beyond the scope of FIXM. This chapter only provides an <u>example</u>
of service description of FF-ICE/1 Service implementations in order to
illustrate how FIXM can be used in support of FF-ICE and to help
implementers develop solutions for FF-ICE.

Describing a service implementation implies making a series of decisions
such as technology selection or naming strategies for service
operations. This chapter has no ambition to impose a particular
selection of technologies or particular service implementation
practices. It provides practical examples for illustration purpose only.

### Target audience

This chapter primarily targets an audience with knowledge of FF-ICE who
are interested in understanding how the information exchanges described
in the FF-ICE Implementation Guidance \[10\] can be realized using FIXM
and a selection of SOA technologies (e.g. AMQP, WSDL, SOAP). This
chapter also serves as a technical introduction to the information
exchanges described in the FF-ICE Implementation Guidance Manual, for
implementers not yet fully familiar with the FF-ICE concept.

This chapter assumes the reader is familiar with the FF-ICE/1
principles, procedures and terminology outlined in the Manual on FF-ICE
Implementation Guidance \[10\].

### The FF-ICE/1 Services

The FF-ICE/1 Implementation Guidance \[10\] describes services as a set
of messages[6] that should be exchanged in the context of a described
behaviour (procedures).

The following diagram illustrates the services identified by FF-ICE/1
and the associated messages.

A message is a discrete unit of communication intended by the source for
consumption by a given recipient or group of recipients. For example,
the ***Planning Service*** is described as a set of exchanges of
messages such as ***Preliminary Flight Plan Message*** or ***Planning
Status Message***.

### Technology Selection

In order to document the FIXM-Based examples in this section, two sets
of technologies have been selected that accommodate the need to exchange
the FF-ICE/1 messages:

-   **SOAP Web Service technologies** allow to exchange request and
    reply messages where the initiative is taken by the service
    consumer.[7]

-   **AMQP** supports the exchange of notification messages where the
    initiative is taken by the service provider.

Appendix XXX Section YYY provides detailed rational for the technology
selection.

*Explain here how a Library can be extended (both core and/or the
application specific elements) and it can be also restricted via
templates. To accommodate regional(or other) requirements.*

Translating FF-ICE FIXM Messages to ATS Messages 
------------------------------------------------

### Target audience

This chapter targets FIXM implementers who want to realise a conversion
between FIXM and ATS message content.

### When should FIXM core be used?

FIXM is an information exchange model developed in support of the ICAO
FF-ICE concept \[9\]. FIXM 4.1.0 specifically serves as a format for
encoding the content of the FF-ICE/1 messages, as described in the
Manual on FF-ICE/1 Implementation Guidance \[10\]. FIXM is not developed
as a permanent alternative to the traditional ICAO FPL 2012 format but
covers the content of the legacy ATS Messages.

The use of FIXM is therefore recommended when implementing information
services supporting the FF-ICE/1 exchanges. The use of FIXM for encoding
existing FPL is also recommended as a useful precursor towards FF-ICE/1.

### Overview

The transition from present day practices to FF-ICE operations is likely
to be somewhat protracted. This is a topic that is being pursued
actively by the ATMRPP \[ATMRPP-WG/24-WP/564\] \[16\], and is recognized
as a key issue in the System Wide Information Management (SWIM) concept
\[15\] \[ICAO Doc 10039\]. During that transition period, there will be
stakeholders who are able to send and receive flight plan information
employing FIXM, while others will employ ICAO ATS messages. In such a
hybrid environment, it is expected that a significant effort will be
expended translating between the FIXM format and the ATS message format.
It is critical for interoperability purposes, and to ensure meaning is
not lost in translation, that the conversion between FIXM and ATS
message content is precisely defined, and that all stakeholders employ
the same translation rules.

There is not a direct correspondence between ATS messages and FIXM,
though there is a close association. At the message level, the
association is with the FF-ICE messages described in section 3.3.3. The
mapping between ATS messages and FIXM focuses on the individual ATS
message fields (7, 8, etc.) rather than the messages themselves. In
general, the mapping is independent of the message type: regardless of
which ATS message field 7 appears, the aircraft identification always
maps to the same FIXM element. In the cases where an ATS message field
item maps to different FIXM elements based on the message type (e.g.
field 13b is estimated off block time in a FPL, but actual take off time
in a DEP), that difference is made explicit in the mapping rule.

### ATS Message Content to FIXM Logical Model Map

#### Purpose & Scope

This chapter provides a mapping between the Flight Information Exchange
Model (FIXM) Logical Model v4.1.0 and International Civil Aviation
Organisation (ICAO) Air Traffic Services (ATS) message content as
defined in ICAO Doc 4444 \[PANS-ATM\] \[8\].

The mapping provides traceability from ATS message content to FIXM
ensuring complete coverage of ATS messages.

This chapter defines a mapping from ICAO Doc 4444 \[PANS-ATM\] ATS
message fields to FIXM logical model elements. The scope covers all
message content defined in appendix 3 of PANS-ATM \[8\]. Supporting
description is provided where the mapping from ATS message content to
the logical model is not clear. The reader is assumed to be familiar
with ICAO ATS messages and the FIXM Logical Model.

This chapter does not address the FIXM Extensible Markup Language (XML)
schemas. The mapping from the logical model to the XML schemas is
relatively straightforward.

#### Guidelines

Section 4.4.4 maps the individual data elements in ATS messages to the
corresponding elements in the FIXM logical model. It is not always clear
how the structural aspects of an ATS message are captured in a FIXM
object. This section provides explanation and guidelines where the
structure is not clear.

The ATS message format consists of a mixture of structured and free
text. The free text components create problems when decoding ATS
messages, regardless of whether the goal is to create FIXM objects from
the ATS messages. The format of ATS messages is in part dictated by the
need for such messages to be readable by a human (presentation is a
concern), whereas FIXM focuses purely on the content and structure
(presentation is not a concern). Those free text aspects of ATS messages
that cause difficulties when decoding are highlighted and discussed.

##### Emergency Message Originator

ATS field 5b is the originator of the emergency message. It consists of
eight letters: location indicator (4), ATS unit designator (3), and
either ‘X’ or a letter identifying the ATS unit division.

It is only possible to create a valid ATS message field 5b from a FIXM
flight if the attribute atcUnitNameOrAlternate is eight upper case
letters.

##### SSR Mode

ATS field 7b is Secondary Surveillance Radar (SSR) mode. PANS-ATM
restricts this to mode A only. FIXM supports SSR code but does not
include explicitly a field for mode (that mode A alone is supported is
implicit in the class name: *ModeACode*).

When creating ATS message content from a FIXM object, set the SSR mode
(field 7b) to A.

##### Number of Aircraft

ATS field 9a is the number of aircraft. PANS-ATM restricts this value to
be in the range 2 through 99. FIXM allows any non-negative number.

When creating ATS message content from a FIXM object, if the
Aircraft.formationCount value is greater than 99, truncate to 99.

A similar comment applies to other ATS message fields that contain
counts:

-   Field 18 TYP (range 2..10);

-   Field 19b (range 1..99);

-   Field 19f (range 1..99 for number of dinghies, 1..999 for dinghy
    capacity).

##### Wake Turbulence Category

PANS-ATM supports wake turbulence categories L, M and H (field 9c).
However, aircraft operators who operate A380’s often specify a wake
turbulence category of J. FIXM supports the value J.

Since J is in common use, when creating a FIXM object from ATS message
content, if wake turbulence category J is specified, include that value
in the ATS message.

##### Navigation/Communication Capabilities

###### No or Unserviceable Equipment

The value ‘N’ in field 10a of an ATS messages indicates, “no
COM/NAV/approach aid equipment for the route to be flown is carried, or
the equipment is unserviceable”. FIXM does not explicitly model the
field 10a code ‘N’. Rather it leaves that code implicit to avoid
redundancy. The relevant items in the FIXM logical model are class
*FlightCapabilities* and its associations *navigation*, *communication*
and *standardCapabilities*.

-   When creating a FIXM object from ATS message content, ignore code
    ‘N’ in field 10a[8].

-   When creating ATS message content from a FIXM object, insert ‘N’ in
    field 10a if an instance of class *FlightCapabilities* is absent, or
    it is present and associations *navigation*, *communication* and
    *standardCapabilities* are all absent.

###### Standard Equipment

The value ‘S’ in field 10a of an ATS message indicates, “Standard
COM/NAV/approach aid equipment for the route to be flown is carried and
serviceable”. ‘S’ is not specific to navigation or communication
capabilities. As such, FIXM represents standard equipment and
capabilities via class *StandardCapabilitiesIndicator* that is
associated with *FlightCapabilities*, being the lowest level class that
sits above the navigation and communication capabilities in the class
hierarchy.

###### PBN Approved

The value ‘R’ in field 10a of an ATS message indicates performance based
navigation (PBN) capability codes are included in field 18 PBN. FIXM
does not explicitly model the field 10a code ‘R’. Rather it leaves that
code implicit to avoid redundancy.

-   When creating a FIXM object from ATS message content, ignore code
    ‘R’ in field 10a[9].

-   When creating ATS message content from a FIXM object, insert ‘R’ in
    field 10a if one or more PBN codes are present in the navigation
    capabilities.

###### Other Equipment and Capabilities

The value ‘Z’ in field 10a of an ATS message indicates that other
communication/navigation capabilities are defined in field 18 (NAV, COM,
DAT). FIXM does not explicitly model field 10a code ‘Z’. Rather, it
leaves that code implicit to avoid redundancy.

-   When creating a FIXM object from ATS message content, ignore code
    ‘Z’ in field 10a[10].

-   When creating ATS message content from a FIXM object, insert ‘Z’ in
    field 10a if at least one of the “other navigation, communication or
    datalink capabilities” fields is present in the FIXM object.

PANS-ATM states: *If the letter G is used, the types of external GNSS
augmentation, if any, are specified in item 18 following the indicator
NAV/*. An ATS message may have content in field 18 NAV/ with ‘G’ in
field 10a but not ‘Z’. The above rule always inserts ‘Z’ in field 10a if
there is content in field 18 NAV/. Consequently, an ATS-FIXM-ATS round
trip may insert a ‘Z’ in field 10a that was not in the original ATS
message.

<span id="_Ref262546619" class="anchor"></span>Figure : Equipment and
Capabilities Object Model

##### Surveillance Capabilities

The value ‘N’ in field 10b of an ATS messages indicates, “no
surveillance equipment for the route to be flown is carried, or the
equipment is unserviceable”. FIXM does not explicitly model the field
10b code ‘N’. Rather it leaves that code implicit to avoid redundancy.
The relevant items in the FIXM logical model are class
*FlightCapabilities* and its association *surveillance*.

-   When creating a FIXM object from ATS message content, ignore code
    ‘N’ in field 10b[11].

-   When creating ATS message content from a FIXM object, insert ‘N’ in
    field 10b if an instance of class *FlightCapabilities* is absent, or
    it is present but no surveillance capability codes are present.

##### Date/Time/Duration Specification

###### UTC

Date/time values in ATS messages are always expressed in Coordinated
Universal Time (UTC). Likewise, FIXM requires times to be expressed in
UTC.

A constraint is placed on class *Base.Types.Time*, the class used to
represent all date/time values in FIXM, such that only UTC times can be
expressed. The constraint mandates that the time zone is ‘Z’.

Example: 20<sup>th</sup> July 1969 at 20:18UTC is expressed as

> 1969-07-20T20:18:00.000Z

In ATS messages, times are expressed in hours and minutes only, while
FIXM supports seconds and fractions of seconds. When converting FIXM to
ATS message content, seconds should be truncated.

###### Date of Flight

The flight departure time is encoded in field 13b of an ATS message, and
is expressed as a four digit UTC value (HHMM). The date on which the
flight departs optionally appears in field 18 DOF (YYMMDD). FIXM encodes
such values as a full date/time, not as distinct date and time values.
As such, the full and unambiguous departure date/time of a flight is
composed from fields 13b and 18 DOF[12].

of the following flight plan fragment.

<span id="_Ref277922327" class="anchor"></span>Figure : Departure
Date/Time Object Model

###### Estimated Flight Time

ATS field 16b is the total estimated elapsed time from take-off to
landing, consisting of four digits in HHMM format. FIXM models this as a
duration which may be of arbitrary length. Consequently, a FIXM flight
may include a duration that is not expressible in an ATS message.

The same comments applies to other ATS message fields that contain
durations:

-   Field 18 EET;

-   Field 18 DLE;

-   Field 19a.

##### Route

An ATS message route description (field 15) is captured in FIXM by class
*RouteTrajectoryGroup* in package
*Flight.FlightRouteTrajectory.RouteTrajectory*.

The initial cruising speed (field 15a) and level (field 15b) are
captured in class *FlightRouteInformation*. Field 15b of an ATS route
may contain the token ‘VFR’ instead of a level. In that case the
*cruisingLevel* attribute of *FlightRouteInformation* should be omitted.

The route is modelled as a series of route elements (class
*RouteTrajectoryElement*) each consisting of a route point and the
designator of the ATS route to the next point, together with associated
information such as delay and changes.

Note this package also accommodates 4D trajectories hence is far richer
in content than is required for ATS message routes. When mapping from
ATS messages to FIXM there is no requirement to create a corresponding
4D trajectory.

###### Varieties of Route

The mapping from field 15 to FIXM is complicated by the fact that a FIXM
object, class *Flight*, can be associated with up to five routes or
trajectories to support FF-ICE processes. The associations are:

-   negotiating (exchange between eASP and eAU during the Planning
    Phase)

-   agreed (by the eASP and eAU during the Planning Phase)

-   filed (by the eAU)

-   current (latest known information)

-   desired (by the eAU)

When mapping ATS message content to FIXM it must be decided which of the
associations is employed to model the route information. Such a decision
cannot be made with respect to field 15 in isolation. The decision is
dependent on the message type in which the route occurs. Table 3
presents the mapping between kinds of route and the message types that
contain field 15 (including those where field 15 is incorporated in
field 22).

###### Route Text

The primary purpose of FIXM is to provide a structured representation of
flight information, with individual elements clearly delineated to
ensure the intent of the route is communicated unambiguously. The
attribute *routeText* in class *FlightRouteInformation* allows the text
of a route description, namely the content of field 15c in the ATS
message, to be recorded in the model. This is provided to support legacy
systems, and to support stakeholders who may not be in full possession
of all necessary aeronautical resource information. When translating
from field 15c of an ATS message to FIXM the route structure should be
decoded and made explicit.

-   When creating a FIXM object from ATS message content, whenever
    possible decode the route and populate the FIXM route structure.

-   When the FIXM route structure is populated, population of the route
    text is optional.

-   For legacy systems where it is not possible to decode the route, the
    route text only may be populated.

-   When the route text is populated, strip leading and trailing white
    space, and replace multiple contiguous white space characters by a
    single space.

-   When creating ATS message content from FIXM, if the route structure
    is available, create the field 15c text from the route structure
    (even if the route text is available).

-   Never populate the route text with anything other than a string that
    complies with the PANS-ATM field 15c route definition.

###### SID and STAR

A SID, if present in the route, is the first item in the route
description. A STAR, if present in the route, is the last item in the
route description. FIXM encodes the SID and STAR as route designators in
the route: attributes *standardInstrumentDeparture* and
*standardInstrumentArrival* in class
*RouteDesignatorToNextElementChoice*.

-   A SID, if included in a route, must appear in the first element of
    the sequence of instances of *RouteTrajectoryElement*. The
    *elementStartPoint* attribute of the same element must not be
    populated.

-   A STAR, if included in a route, must appear in the last element of
    the sequence of instances of *RouteTrajectoryElement*.

###### Direct Route Segments

In ICAO ATS messages, the presence of DCT between two route points
indicates the aircraft will fly between the points outside a designated
ATS route. In the ICAO ATS message it is also allowed to specify two
consecutive route points that are separated neither by an ATS route
designator nor by DCT; this is most commonly seen in User Preferred
Routes (UPR). In such a case there is an implied DCT between the route
points.

FIXM models DCT through class *OtherRouteDesignator*, related to class
*RouteDesignatorToNextElementChoice* by attribute otherRouteDesignator.

-   When creating a FIXM object from ATS message content, indicate a
    direct route segment by setting attribute *otherRouteDesaignator* to
    DIRECT.

-   When creating ATS message content from a FIXM object, if
    *otherRouteDesignator* of class *RouteDesignatorToNextElementChoice*
    is set to DIRECT, insert “DCT” into the ATS route.

-   When creating ATS message content from a FIXM object, if an instance
    of class *RouteDesignatorToNextElementChoice* is not present, or is
    present and the value of attribute *otherRouteDesignator* is
    UNSPECIFIED, do not insert any text between the current and next
    point.

Refer to Figure 37 for an example of “DCT” in a route.

###### Route Truncation

The token ‘T’ in a route description indicates the route has been
truncated. That is, the entire route through to the destination has not
been presented. When included, the route truncation indicator must be
the last item in the route description.

Route truncation is modelled by class *RouteTruncationIndicator* in
package *RouteTrajectory*, and is associated with class
*RouteTrajectoryElement*. A route is modelled by an ordered sequence of
instances of *RouteTrajectoryElement*. The truncation indicator may only
be associated with the last element in the sequence (it is meaningless
to truncate a route prior to the last element).

Refer to Figure 37 for an example of route truncation.

###### Route Changes

Route and trajectory information is captured in the FIXM logical model
in package *Flight.FlightRouteTrajectory*. The route itself is captured
in sub-package *RouteTrajectory*, while changes to speed and level in a
route are captured in sub-package *RouteChanges*.

This section defines how the route changes defined in PANS-ATM are
mapped to the FIXM logical model. There are three variants allowed in an
ATS message: speed/level change, cruise/climb, and cruise/climb with no
specific upper limit. One example of each of those changes and how they
map to the FIXM logical model is presented in Table 4.

</tbody>
</table>

Notes:

-   The token ‘C’ is inserted in a flight plan to indicate a cruise
    climb phase. This does not appear in the FIXM logical model. The
    presence of an instance of class *CruiseClimbStart* indicates cruise
    climb, as demonstrated in Figure 36.

-   The token ‘PLUS’ is used to indicate cruise climb is planned to
    commence above the specified level. This does not appear in the FIXM
    logical model. ‘PLUS’ is indicated by an instance of
    *CruiseClimbStart* where *level* (of class
    *FlightLevelOrAltitudeOrRangeChoice*) is populated with an instance
    of FlightLevelOrAltitudeChoice), whereas a cruise/climb with an
    upper limit is indicated by an instance of *CruiseClimbStart* where
    *level* is populated with an instance of *VerticalRange*.

-   *CrusingSpeedChange* and *CruisingLevelChange* have an optional
    association *activation*. There is no necessity to populate this
    attribute.

Figure 36 presents examples of the three kinds of level constraint.

Model

###### RIF

ICAO field 18 RIF, if present, contains the route details to the revised
destination, followed by the revised destination aerodrome. This is
modelled in FIXM by class *ReclearanceInFlight* in package
*Flight.Arrival*. The route component is modelled by attribute
*routeToRevisedDestination* and the destination by attribute
*filedRevisedDestinationAerodrome*.

The route component is constructed via the same rules as for field 15c.
However, in FIXM the route to revised destination is modelled as an
unstructured string.

Figure 38 presents the object model corresponding to field 18 RIF of the
sample flight plan in Figure 33:

RIF/GUXIB R587 MEPAB G591 LTO NWWW

<span id="_Ref262547023" class="anchor"></span>Figure : Route to Revised
Destination Object Model

###### DLE

ICAO field 18 DLE, if present, contains points along the route at which
delay will occur; the aircraft essentially goes ‘off plan’ for the
stated duration. Each DLE point must appear in the route (field 15c).
For ATS messages, this requires that a consistency check be performed on
the flight plan to ensure the DLE points are listed in the route. FIXM
avoids the need for a check and the duplication of route points by
incorporating a delay value in the corresponding route element.
Specifically, the delay duration appears in attribute *delayValue* of
class *EnRouteDelay*, which is associated with class
*RouteTrajectoryElement*.

The *EnRouteDelay* class additionally has attributes *delayReason*,
*delayReference* and *delayType*. When creating a FIXM object from ATS
message content, the attributes *delayReason*, *delayReference* and
*delayType* should be omitted.

Figure 39 presents the object model for a fragment of the route in the
flight plan contained in Figure 33, incorporating the information in
field 18 DLE:

Object Model

##### Aircraft Type

When the type of aircraft that conducts a flight does not have an ICAO
aircraft type designator \[ICAO Doc 8643\] \[12\] or the flight is a
formation, the value ZZZZ is inserted in field 9b and the aircraft type
information is inserted in field 18 TYP. The following fragment is an
example.

-10ZZZZ/M

....

-TYP/2F15 5F5 3B2

Note the structured nature of the TYP field: two F15s, five F5s, and
three B2s. The value in field 18 TYP may exhibit structure as in this
example above for a formation. However, this may not be so in other
cases, where the (non-designator) type of aircraft is listed, as in

-ZZZZ/L

....

-TYP/ECLIPSE 500

Figure 40 presents the object model corresponding to each of the above
flight plan fragments.

<img src="media/image43.png" style="width:6.30208in;height:3.51042in" alt="ATYP" />

<span id="_Ref265180403" class="anchor"></span>Figure : Aircraft Type
Object Model

Notes:

-   If it is not possible to decode the content of field 18 TYP, create
    a single instance of class *AircraftType* to record the entire
    content of 18 TYP.

-   The sum of the *numberOfAircraft* attributes in the instances of
    *AircraftType* class should equal the *formationCount* attribute in
    class *Aircraft*.

-   If the number of aircraft is 1, the *formationCount* and
    *numberOfAircraft* attributes may be omitted (though may be included
    as in Figure 40).

##### Aircraft Registration

The registration mark for an aircraft may include a ‘-’ character, e.g.
VH-ABC. While PANS-ATM does not explicitly state that ‘-’ should be
omitted when including field 18 REG, it is rare that ‘-’ is included,
i.e. VHABC is the norm. FIXM does not support ‘-’ in the registration.

When creating a FIXM object from an ATS message, strip the ‘-’ character
if present in the registration.

FIXM supports multiple registrations. ATS messages support a single
registration. When creating a FIXM object from an ATS message, the
registration is a sequence one length one.

##### When creating an ATS message from a FIXM object, if the FIXM object contains multiple registrations, select the first registration in the sequence.Departure Aerodrome

When the departure aerodrome for a flight does not have an ICAO location
indicator code \[ICAO Doc 7910\] \[11\], the value ZZZZ is inserted in
field 13a and the departure point is inserted in field 18 DEP. According
to PANS-ATM the content of 18 DEP is “name and location of departure
aerodrome” where the location is expressed either as a
latitude/longitude or as a bearing and distance from a designated point.
In the case the aircraft did not take off from an aerodrome, the first
point of the route or the marker radio beacon may be specified. This can
be problematic when decoding 18 DEP for the population of FIXM:

-   Analysis of flight plans received by Airservices Australia shows
    that the majority of flight plans that include 18 DEP contain only a
    latitude/longitude in 18 DEP. This is, strictly speaking, not
    compliant with PANS-ATM, yet it is common practice.

-   The name of the departure aerodrome may consist of multiple words so
    it may not be obvious how to parse the content of 18 DEP.

Figure 41 presents two object models corresponding to the following
flight plan fragment.

-ZZZZ1231

....

-DEP/WESTMEAD HOSPITAL 3349S15059E

<span id="_Ref277670899" class="anchor"></span>Figure : Departure
Aerodrome Object Model

The first shows the fully decoded 18 DEP. The second shows the approach
where 18 DEP cannot be decoded successfully: insert the entire content
of 18 DEP in the *name* attribute of *AerodromeReference*.

##### Destination Aerodrome

When the destination aerodrome for a flight does not have an ICAO
location indicator code \[ICAO Doc 7910\] \[11\], the value ZZZZ is
inserted in field 16a and the destination point is inserted in field 18
DEST. According to PANS-ATM the content of 18 DEST is “name and location
of destination aerodrome” where the location is expressed either as a
latitude/longitude or as a bearing and distance from a named significant
point. This can be problematic when decoding 18 DEST for the population
of FIXM:

-   Analysis of flight plans received by Airservices Australia shows
    that the majority of flight plans that include 18 DEST contain only
    a latitude/longitude in 18 DEST. This is, strictly speaking, not
    compliant with PANS-ATM, yet it is common practice.

-   The name of the departure aerodrome may consist of multiple words so
    it may not be obvious how to parse the content of 18 DEST.

Refer to section Departure Aerodrome for an equivalent example in the
context of field 18 DEP.

##### Arrival Aerodrome

An ATS arrival message records the arrival aerodrome in field 17. If the
arrival aerodrome does not have an ICAO location indicator code, the
value ZZZZ is inserted in field 17a and the arrival aerodrome name is
recorded in field 17c.

FIXM accommodates both a destination (intended) aerodrome and an actual
arrival aerodrome.

-   Record the actual arrival aerodrome in attribute
    *arrivalAerodrome.locationIndicator* of class
    *Arrival.AerodromeReference*;

-   If the actual arrival aerodrome does not have an ICAO location
    indicator, record the arrival aerodrome name against attribute
    *arrivalAerodorme.name* of class *Arrival.AerodromeReference*.

Aerodrome Object Model

##### Alternate Destination

When the alternate destination aerodrome for a flight does not have an
ICAO location indicator code \[ICAO Doc 7910\] \[11\], the value ZZZZ is
inserted in field 16c and the alternate destination point is inserted in
field 18 ALTN. Although similar to 18 DEP and 18 DEST there is an added
complication that up to two alternates may be specified, hence 18 ALTN
could include two name/location pairs.

The alternate destination aerodromes are captured by FIXM in attribute
*destinationAerodromeAlternate* of class *Arrival*.

The following flight plan fragment presents field 16 and field 18 items
that relate to destination aerodrome and alternates.

-ZZZZ0035 YSBK ZZZZ

……..

-DEST/WESTMEAD HOSPITAL 3348S15059E ALTN/EASTERN CREEK

Figure 43 presents the FIXM representation in an object model.

<img src="media/image46.png" style="width:5.79167in;height:4.6875in" alt="ALTN" />

<span id="_Ref262563475" class="anchor"></span>Figure : Destination and
Alternate Object Model

Decoding is problematic if two free text names are included in ALTN. For
example, consider the flight plan fragment

-YSBK0035 ZZZZ ZZZZ

……..

-ALTN/WESTMEAD HOSPITAL EASTERN CREEK

where “WESTMEAD HOSPITAL” and “EASTERN CREEK” are distinct points. None
of the tokens is a latitude/longitude or a bearing&distance, so it is
very difficult to distinguish them. In this case create a single
alternate location (instance of *AerodromeReference*) and set the *name*
attribute to “WESTMEAD HOSPITAL EASTERN CREEK”.

##### En-Route Alternate

ICAO field 18 RALT, if present, indicates the (one or more) en-route
alternates. Each alternate is one of:

-   ICAO location indicator;

-   Aerodrome name as listed in Aeronautical Information Publication
    (AIP);

-   Geographic location as a latitude/longitude;

-   Bearing and distance from a designated point.

An en-route alternate is represented in the model by attribute
*alternateAerodrome* of class *EnRoute* in package *Flight.EnRoute*.
Each alternate is an *AerodromeReference* (see section
AerodromeReference).

Figure 44 presents two object models that represent the en-route
alternate listed below.

RALT/YSBK WESTMEAD HOSPITAL SY102025

<span id="_Ref265173251" class="anchor"></span>Figure : En-Route
Alternate Object Model

The first shows the fully decoded 18 RALT. The second shows the approach
where 18 RALT cannot be decoded successfully: insert the entire content
of 18 RALT in the *name* attribute of *AerodromeReference*.

##### Take-off Alternate

ICAO field 18 TALT, if present, indicates the (one or more) take-off
alternates. Each alternate is one of:

-   ICAO location indicator;

-   Aerodrome name as listed in AIP;

-   Geographic location as a latitude/longitude;

-   Bearing and distance from a designated point.

A take-off alternate is represented in the model by attribute
*takeOffAlternateAerodrome* of class *Departure* in package
*Flight.Departure*. Each alternate is an *AerodromeReference* (see
section AerodromeReference).

Refer to section En-Route Alternate for an equivalent example in the
context of en-route alternate.

##### Air Filed

When a flight plan is filed in the air, the value AFIL is inserted in
field 13a and the ATS unit from which supplementary flight plan
information can be obtained is specified in field 18 DEP. The mapping
employs the attribute *flightPlanSubmitter* of class *Flight* for this
purpose, though the name is not immediately suggestive of the purpose
for which it is being used. In this situation the following rules should
be applied:

-   Populate the *name* attribute of *PersonOrOrganization* (via
    attribute *flightPlanSubmitter*) with the content of field 18 DEP.

-   Populate the *airfileIndicator* of class *Departure* (with the
    constant value AIRFILE).

-   Populate the attribute *airfileRouteStartTime* of class
    *FlightRouteInformation* in package
    *Flight.FlightRouteTrajectory.RouteTrajectory* with the content of
    field 13b.

-   The departure aerodrome (*aerodrome*) and departure time
    (*estimatedOffBlockTime*) of class *Departure* are not populated.

Figure 45 presents the FIXM representation of the following air filed
flight plan (fragment) as an object model.

-AFIL1254

....

-DEP/YBBBZQZA

<span id="_Ref268982502" class="anchor"></span>Figure : AFIL Object
Model

##### Remarks

The remarks item (RMK/) of field 18 of a flight plan maps to attribute
*remarks* of class *Flight*. The content of remarks should not include
the ‘RMK/’ label. That is, a flight plan containing

> RMK/TCAS II EQUIPPED

results in

> remarks = “TCAS II EQUIPPED”

The same is true of all field 18 items. The item label is not included
in the content; it is implied by the structure.

##### Supplementary Information

Supplementary information (field 19) contains additional information
about a flight that is not transmitted in the flight plan.

Field 19b is the number of persons on board. Appendix 2 of PANS-ATM
suggests ‘TBN’ is inserted in field 19b if the number of persons on
board is not known. Appendix 3 suggests field 19b is omitted if the
value is not known. FIXM does not allow a distinction between the
absence of field 19b and its presence with value ‘TBN’.

-   When converting ATS message content to FIXM, if field 19b is
    populated with ‘TBN’, omit the *personsOnBoard* attribute from the
    FIXM *SupplementaryData* object.

-   When converting a FIXM object to ATS message field 19, if the
    *personsOnBoard* attribute is absent, do not include any text for
    field 19b.

The above rule means an ATS-FIXM-ATS round trip would cause the text
‘P/TBN’ to be removed from the original ATS message.

Figure 46 presents the object model corresponding to the following field
19 example.

<span id="_Ref277670947" class="anchor"></span>Figure : Supplementary
Information Object Model

##### Alerting Search and Rescue Information

Field 20 of an ATS message, alerting search and rescue information,
consists of eight items, each of which, if not known by the originator,
is replaced by ‘NIL’ or ‘NOT KNOWN’. The first five items are precisely
defined, but the final three are free text fields, which leads to
difficulties when decoding.

It is beyond the scope of this chapter to address such a decoding issue.

##### Radio Failure Information

Field 21 of an ATS message, radio failure information, consists of six
items, each of which, if not known by the originator, is replaced by
‘NIL’ or ‘NOT KNOWN’. The first four items are precisely defined, but
the final two are free text fields, which leads to difficulties when
decoding.

It is beyond the scope of this chapter to address such a decoding issue.

#### Base Constructs

The ATS messages to FIXM logical model map in section 4.4.4 at times
maps an ATS message field to a structured FIXM entity without providing
further detail. This occurs with ‘lower level’ entities that are defined
in the FIXM *Base* package. One such example is field 15a, which is
mapped to the *Base* class *TrueAirspeed*.

This section provides further detail for the mapping to *Base* classes
where those classes represent compound values.

##### FlightLevelOrAltitude

A level or altitude is captured in FIXM by the class
*FlightLevelOrAltitudeChoice* in package *Base.RangesAndChoices*. It
consists of choice between flight level (class *FlightLevel*) or
altitude (class *Altitude*). In each case a unit of measure is specified
(respectively *UomFlightLevel* and *UomAltitude*) and a vertical
distance (class *VerticalDistance* in package *Base.Measures*) expressed
as a floating point number. Table 5 provides a mapping between the
level/altitude in PANS-ATM ATS messages and the level/altitude in FIXM.

Notes:

-   For ICAO flight level type ‘F’, the ICAO and FIXM values are the
    same (though the ICAO value is a whole number while the FIXM value
    is a floating point number).

-   For ICAO flight level type ‘S’, the ICAO and FIXM values are the
    same (though the ICAO value is a whole number while the FIXM value
    is a floating point number).

-   For ICAO altitude type ‘A’, multiply by 100 when converting to FIXM.

-   For ICAO altitude type ‘A’, divide by 100 and round when converting
    from FIXM.

-   For ICAO altitude type ‘M’, multiply by 10 when converting to FIXM.

-   For ICAO altitude type ‘M’, divide by 10 and round when converting
    from FIXM.

-   Since rounding is necessary when converting from FIXM, a round trip
    transformation is not guaranteed to fully preserve meaning. For
    example, the FIXM altitude ‘2640 feet’ becomes ‘A026’ in which if
    converted back to FIXM becomes ‘2600 feet’.

##### TrueAirspeed

In ATS messaging speed is either true air speed or Mach number. This is
captured by class *TrueAirspeed* in package *Base.Measures*. It consists
of the unit of measurement (class *UomAirspeed*) and a (floating point)
value. Table 6 provides a mapping between the speed in ATS messages and
the speed in FIXM.

<span id="_Ref262563928" class="anchor"></span>Table : Speed Mapping

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th><strong>ATS Message</strong></th>
<th><strong>FIXM</strong></th>
<th></th>
<th></th>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Notes:

-   In an ATS message the Mach value is represented by a three-digit
    string, which when interpreted as a number is 100 times greater than
    the Mach value (e.g. M080 is Mach 0.8).

-   Converting from FIXM to ATS message, multiply by 100 and round.

-   Converting from ATS message to FIXM, divide by 100.

-   Since rounding is necessary when converting from FIXM, a round trip
    transformation is not guaranteed to preserve meaning. For example,
    the FIXM Mach value of ‘0.841’ becomes ‘M084’ which when converted
    back to FIXM becomes ‘0.84’.

##### GeographicalPosition

In ATS messages, a geographic location is defined either in full
degrees, with a corresponding direct representation in decimal degrees,
or in degrees and minutes

> dd<sub>1</sub>mm<sub>1</sub>\[NS\]ddd<sub>2</sub>mm<sub>2</sub>\[EW\]

which is converted by

> decimal latitude = dd<sub>1</sub> + (mm<sub>1</sub>/60)
>
> decimal longitude = ddd<sub>2</sub> + (mm<sub>2</sub>/60)

When converting from FIXM to ATS messages, the position can only be
represented to the nearest minute, resulting in a loss of precision.

A round trip starting from FIXM may not preserve meaning. Example:

> FIXM latitude: 12.42 degrees
>
> Convert to ATS: 1225N (12 degrees, 25 minutes)
>
> Convert back to FIXM: 12.4166… degrees

##### SignificantPoint

A significant point can be a designated point (navaid or waypoint), a
geographic location (latitude/longitude), or a relative point (bearing
and distance from a designated point). Three subclasses of
*SignificantPoint* (which is abstract) capture the options:

-   Class *DesignatedPointOrNavaid* models the designator value via
    attribute *designator* of class *SignificantPointDesignator*.

-   Class *RelativePoint* models the relative point via attributes
    *referencePoint* (a *DesignatedPointOrNavaid*), *bearing* and
    *distance*.

-   Class *PositionPoint* models the point via attribute *position* of
    class *GeographicalPosition* (section GeographicalPosition).

Examples of significant points are presented in Figure 41 and Figure 44.

##### Frequency

Radio frequency can appear in fields 20d and 21b of an ATS message. In
all examples in PANS-ATM this is presented as an unadorned decimal
number (e.g. 126.7). The expanded text in PANS-ATM describing the
examples always states MHz.

The global guidance for ATC Interfacility Data Communications (AIDC)
\[PAN AIDC ICD\] \[14\] is more specific as presented in Table 7.

<span id="_Ref456782567" class="anchor"></span>Table : PAN AIDC ICD
Frequency

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th></th>
<th><strong>Range</strong></th>
<th><strong>Units</strong></th>

</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">

<td>117.975 to 137.000</td>
<td>MHz</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>UHF</td>
<td>225.000 to 399.975</td>
<td>MHz</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

The mapping for ATS messages follows the PAN AIDC ICD convention.

FIXM captures radio frequency in class *Frequency* of package
*Base.Measures*. This class has a mandatory associated value: the unit
of measure (class *UomFrequency*). The frequency unit is either KHZ or
MHZ. If the frequency is four or five digits without a decimal point,
set the *uom* attribute to KHZ, otherwise set the *uom* attribute to
MHZ.

Using FIXM for other use cases
==============================

FIXM provides globally harmonized flight data definitions and a
standardized, hierarchical organization for representing information
about a flight. Though its main requirements driver is currently ICAO
FF-ICE, FIXM is intended as a general standard for representing all
flight data, and the use of FIXM is encouraged for any situation in
which flight data is exchanged between systems. Providing flight data in
FIXM format has the additional benefit of allowing the data to be more
easily ingested by any system already set up to process other FIXM
feeds. Essentially, the more FIXM is used, the more useful it becomes.

To help illustrate the use of FIXM outside of FF-ICE, this chapter
imagines a fictitious FIXM user, Example Air Services (XAS), that
expands their use of FIXM through increasingly complex use cases. Each
section below includes a high-level example of how the user accomplishes
their goals using the type of FIXM product described in the section.
When appropriate, these use cases are paired with the step-by-step
examples of how to build various FIXM products provided in the
Appendices at the end of this document.

Using FIXM Core without an Application Library
----------------------------------------------

In some cases, the nature of the messaging infrastructure employed for a
particular data exchange makes the use of Application Libraries
unnecessary or irrelevant (perhaps due to the infrastructure’s robust
metadata/messaging header support) or the nature of the exchange itself
does not require any accompanying message data structures (perhaps due
to the exchange’s simplicity). In these situations, the use of FIXM Core
alone should be sufficient.

FIXM Core is the repository in which all globally applicable flight data
structures reside. The root field of the entire flight information
hierarchy is the Flight class (in the physical model, the Flight
element).

<img src="media/image50.emf" style="width:6.26806in;height:4.11389in" />

When using FIXM Core for data representation, all XML documents must
begin with this Flight element. Similarly, the Fixm.xsd schema file is
the root schema of FIXM Core. Whether validating FIXM Core XML documents
or using automated code generation utilities (such as JAXB), this is the
schema file that should be referenced.

*Example: Departure/Arrival Alerts*

Our fictitious user XAS begins their use of FIXM wanting to publish
departure and arrival alerts for flights they monitor. XAS sets up a
publishing service with which they send out arrival and departure
messages to a single endpoint their consumers can monitor to receive the
alerts. Due to the simplicity of their service, the use of FIXM Core
alone is sufficient for their needs. XAS constructs XML messages
starting with the Flight element to convey their data and instructs
their consumers to validate these messages against FIXM Core’s Fixm.xsd
schema file. Below is an example of how the XML payload of a departure
alert coming from this service may appear.

&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;

&lt;fx:Flight xmlns:fx="http://www.fixm.aero/flight/4.2"
xmlns:fb="http://www.fixm.aero/base/4.2"&gt;

&lt;fx:departure&gt;

&lt;fx:actualTimeOfDeparture&gt;2020-01-01T00:03:00Z&lt;/fx:actualTimeOfDeparture&gt;

&lt;fx:aerodrome&gt;

&lt;fb:locationIndicator&gt;KBOS&lt;/fb:locationIndicator&gt;

&lt;/fx:aerodrome&gt;

&lt;/fx:departure&gt;

&lt;fx:flightIdentification&gt;

&lt;fx:aircraftIdentification&gt;ABC1234&lt;/fx:aircraftIdentification&gt;

&lt;/fx:flightIdentification&gt;

&lt;fx:gufi
codeSpace="urn:uuid"&gt;3e7f6a63-6c3b-4f0f-844b-4b84338ed103&lt;/fx:gufi&gt;

&lt;/fx:Flight&gt;

Using FIXM Core with an Application Library
-------------------------------------------

### Basic Message Application Library

The Basic Message Application Library is intended to enhance FIXM Core
by providing basic messaging support for users, including message types
and timestamps as well as the ability to batch multiple flight messages
together into a single aggregate message. It also provides extension
hooks for users who wish to add their own custom messaging fields. Users
who only require this basic level of message support are encouraged to
use the Basic Message Application Library.

This application library contains two root fields that can be used as an
entry point: Message and MessageCollection.

<img src="media/image51.emf" style="width:5.99514in;height:3.93264in" />

When using Basic Message for data representation, all XML documents must
begin with one of these two elements. Similarly, like Fixm.xsd for Core,
the BasicMessage.xsd schema file is the root schema of the Basic Message
Application Library and is the file that should be referenced for
validation or use with any XML utilities.

Unlike FF-ICE Message, the Basic Message Application Library focuses
only on providing users with generic and reusable message data
structures. It does not provide any message template since it is not
linked to any particular operational use of FIXM.

Users who wish to include additional message data structures beyond what
is provided in Basic Message (but who do not wish to create templates
for a pre-defined set of messages) are encouraged to do so via creating
an Extension to Basic Message (see Section 4.3.1 and Section 4.3.3 below
for more on this). Users who wish to create message templates for their
systems are encouraged to do so via creating their own Application
Library (see Section 4.2.2 for details).

*Example: Batch Updates*

Returning to our fictitious user, XAS has launched a successful
departure and arrival alert service using FIXM Core alone but is now
interested in expanding their capabilities. Some of XAS’s consumers
suffer from network outages and have requested an additional service
which they could use to invoke a bulk update containing all the alerts
they might have missed during such an outage.

XAS determines that Basic Message should be sufficient to meet the needs
of this new service. The MessageCollection element allows XAS to batch
together as many alerts as needed for the update, and the timestamp
associated with each message provides the additional benefit of letting
the consumer know exactly when the alert had originally been sent. XAS
decides to construct all updates using MessageCollection as the root
element to make parsing the updates more consistent and instructs
recipients of these updates to validate the XML against
BasicMessage.xsd. Below is a snippet of what the XML payload of such an
update may look like.

&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;

&lt;msg:MessageCollection xmlns:msg="http://www.fixm.aero/app/msg/1.0"
xmlns:fx="http://www.fixm.aero/flight/4.2"

&lt;/fx:aerodrome&gt;

&lt;/fx:departure&gt;

&lt;/msg:message&gt;

&lt;msg:timestamp&gt;2020-01-02T00:05:00Z&lt;/msg:timestamp&gt;

&lt;msg:type&gt;BULK\_UPDATE&lt;/msg:type&gt;

&lt;/msg:MessageCollection&gt;

### Creating an Application Library

If the organization of Basic Message does not suit the user’s data
exchange or if the user wants to create message templates to more fully
lock down and standardize their message structures and content, they
should consider creating their own custom Application Library.

As described in Section 2.2.2 above, Application Libraries enhance FIXM
Core by adding context specific message data structures and as well as
stricter validation rules via message templates. An Application should
define its own namespace to distinguish it from FIXM Core as well as
creating one or more root elements to be used as an entry point into the
Library. If the Application includes message templates, it may have more
than one root schema: one for using the Application Library alone with
no further restrictions and one for use with the templates. The FF-ICE
Message Application Library is a good example of this, with users
referencing FficeMessage.xsd for unrestricted use of the Library or
FficeTemplates.xsd for making use of the thirteen templates used to
represent the FF-ICE messages.

While the content and organization of an Application Library depends
entirely on the needs of the data exchange it is intended to support,
the FF-ICE Message Application and Basic Message Libraries should
provide a useful set of examples for how to build a Library with and
without associated templates. To supplement this, Appendix A below
provides step-by-step instructions on how to create a simple
Application.

*Example: Upgraded Alerts*

At this point, our fictitious user XAS has decided to upgrade their
original alert service to be able to send departure and arrival messages
to specific recipients (rather than maintaining a single, common
endpoint for all consumers) as well as making use of templates to
clearly lockdown the expected format of the alert messages. To
accomplish this, XAS decides to create their own Application Library.

This custom Application Library defines its own namespace
(“http://www.fixm.aero/app/example/1.0”) and root
element(“ExampleMessage”) as well as a number of header fields needed to
represent data XAS wants to exchange with each alert (“sender”,
“recipient”, “timestamp”, and “type”). XAS then goes on to create two
templates: one that locks down the content of a departure alert and
another for the arrival alert. Details on how to build this Application
Library along with more specifics as to its content are supplied below
in Appendix A.

With the Application Library built, XAS instructs consumers to make use
of the ExampleTemplates.xsd file described in Appendix A when validating
the new alert messages. Below is an example of how the XML payload of
one of the new arrival alert messages coming from this service may
appear.

\[TBD once Appendix A is finished\]

Using FIXM Core with an Extension
---------------------------------

### Creating a new Extension

If a FIXM user requires additional fields beyond what is available in
FIXM Core or an Application Library, Extensions can be used to meet this
need. Similar to Applications, Extensions should define their own
namespaces to distinguish them from FIXM Core, Application Libraries,
and each other. Extensions should also provide a root schema file (that
will import FIXM Core and/or the Application Library the Extension works
with) for use with XML validators and utilities. Unlike Applications,
Extensions should not define their own root elements but, rather, make
use of the root elements defined in whatever schemas they extend.

As noted in 2.2.3 above, there are a number of general guidelines for
constructing FIXM Extensions (e.g., make use extension hooks, don’t
duplicate Core fields, etc.). Apart from that, the content and
organization of an Extension is largely dependent on the data set the
user wishes to represent. Appendix B below provides a detailed,
step-by-step example of how to create a simple Extension that should
help guide any users interested in creating their own.

*Example: Position Reports*

Our fictitious user XAS next decides to branch out beyond just providing
departure and arrival alerts. A number of consumers have been asking if
periodic position reports are available for the flights XAS monitors.
While XAS has this data, there are currently no fields present in FIXM
Core for representing an active flight’s current position. To address
this, XAS decides so create their own FIXM Extension.

This new Extension defines its own namespace
(“http://www.fixm.aero/ext/example/1.0”) as well as a number of fields
XAS wishes to add to what is currently available in FIXM
(“sequenceNumber” and “position”). Based on lessons learned during their
work with departure and arrival alerts, XAS choses to apply the
Extension to Basic Message as well as Core to take advantage of Basic
Message’s existing MessageCollection element. This allows XAS the option
of using Message as a root element if they wish to send single position
reports or MessageCollection if they wish to send many at once. Details
on how to build this Extension along with more specifics as to its
content are supplied below in Appendix B.

With the Extension built, XAS instructs consumers to make use of the
Example.xsd file described in Appendix B when validating position
reports. Below is an example of how the XML payload of one of these
position reports may appear.

&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;

&lt;msg:Message xmlns:xmp="http://www.fixm.aero/ext/example/1.0"

&lt;msg:extension xsi:type="xmp:ExampleMessageType"&gt;

&lt;xmp:sequenceNumber&gt;1&lt;/xmp:sequenceNumber&gt;

&lt;/msg:extension&gt;

&lt;msg:flight&gt;

&lt;fx:enRoute&gt;

&lt;fx:extension xsi:type="xmp:ExampleEnRouteType"&gt;

### Using Multiple Extensions

There are times when a FIXM user may wish to create an XML document that
makes use of more than one Extension at the same time. Assuming the
Extensions are built following FIXM best practices, this should present
no difficulties.

FIXM encourages users to attach their Extensions to Core or an
Application via the built-in extension hooks located throughout the
models. The primary reason for this is to allow FIXM to support multiple
Extensions simultaneously. Each Extension hook has a high multiplicity
(standardly 0..2000) that allows many different Extensions to target the
same areas of FIXM without interfering with each other.

The simplest way to allow multiple Extensions to work together in a
single XML document is to create a new schema file that imports all the
needed components (Core, Application Library, and Extensions) into one
place[13]. This new schema can be used as the root schema file for XML
validators and utilities. Each Extension can then be applied to its own
extension hook, and the multiple Extensions can used together as needed.

*Example: Multiple Extensions*

As XAS’s FIXM operations expand, they begin exchanging data with other
systems that have created their own Extensions. One such system has an
Extension which supplies enhanced handoff data used when flights
transition from one controller to another.

XAS wishes to create a new position report service that contains this
additional handoff data. They decide to pursue this by creating a new
schema that allows the two Extensions to be used at the same time by
importing all the needed components into one place and then instructing
consumers to use this as the root schema file when validating these new
reports. Below is an example of what that schema file may look like.

&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt;

&lt;xs:schema xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"

schemaLocation="../handoff/Handoff.xsd"/&gt;

&lt;/xs:schema&gt;

### Using an Extension together with an Application

In principle, as can be seen in detail in Appendix B below, applying an
Extension to an Application is no different than applying one to FIXM
Core. In fact, applying an Extension to the Basic Messaging Application
Library is the recommended approach for adding additional message data
structures when no templates are needed, and applying Extensions to
Application Libraries that include templates should be no different
(assuming the templates retain their extension hooks). It is just a
matter of importing the Application Library in question and making use
of its extension hooks. That said, there are some aspects of using
Extensions and templates together that have not yet been fully explored.

One area under active investigation is applying an Application Library
directly to an Extension. To date, the only two Application Libraries
that have been developed are Basic Message and FF-ICE Message. Both of
these Applications only apply themselves to Core. In theory, an
Application Library could directly import an Extension just as easily as
it imports Core and apply templates to the Extension content in the same
way it does to Core fields. As practical examples of this are explored,
this section will be updated with more information about how to proceed
(or warnings as to why this is discouraged).

*Example: Position Report Template*

Returning to our fictitious user one final time, XAS has created their
own Application Library for distributing departure and arrival alerts
but has a separate feed that makes use of a different set of schemas for
distributing their position reports. XAS would prefer to consolidate
their two feeds into one and use the same set of schemas for all of
their data.

XAS decides to update their position report Extension to target their
own Example Message Application Library rather than Basic Message and
add a new POSITION\_REPORT enumeration to the Application’s type field
(see Appendix A and Appendix B for details). This should be sufficient
to allow XAS to use one set of schemas for all of their data sets.
However, this creates an odd discrepancy between departure/arrival
alerts and position reports. The alerts are fully described in the
Application’s templates while position reports receive no such guidance.
Without applying the Application to the Extension as well as Core, there
does not seem to be a clear way forward to address this.

As noted above, the best way to approach this matter is currently under
investigation so this example is only provided to illustrate the issues
involved, not detail the recommended solution. This section will be
updated as appropriate after best practices have been established.

A set of sample FIXM formatted flight data \[2\] has been created and is
available within the Implementation Guidance zip archive on the
FIXM.aero website \[5\]. The intent is to provide implementers with
examples of how an assortment of standard flight data items should be
expressed in FIXM. This has been done primarily by using current ATS
messages as a source of sample data.

*Note: While exchanging ATS messages is not the main intent of FIXM, ATS
messages were used because they provide a real-world source of sample
data. In addition, this activity provides concrete examples of the
mapping from ATS Message Content to FIXM that is presented in Chapter*
***Error! Reference source not found.**.*

Samples are organized as a set of files, where each file contains FIXM
representation of an ATS message type that is documented in ICAO Doc
4444 \[PANS-ATM\]. None of the sample files includes every possible
field or every possible alteration of the field, but the set as a whole
represents diverse operational data.

FIXM XML Structural Overview
----------------------------

The FIXM XML Schema, based on the FIXM Logical Model, arranges
information about flights in a different manner than the ATS message
format. While the ATS format emphasizes space (and therefore bandwidth)
savings, the FIXM format emphasizes structure and clarity. Here is a
“skeleton” for a typical Flight Plan message. It does not show every
field that will be included in upcoming FF-ICE messages but shows many
of the common fields found in the ATS messages that have been converted
to FIXM format. Some messages, such as Departure and Arrival, do not
have route trajectory and aircraft information, for example, and are
therefore much more compact than messages containing full Flight Plan
data.

&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;

&lt;/fx:aircraft&gt;

&lt;fx:arrival&gt;

&lt;!-- Destination aerodrome and alternates appear here. In the case of
an arrival message, arrival time and aerodrome also appear --&gt;

&lt;/fx:arrival&gt;

&lt;fx:departure&gt;

&lt;!-- Departure aerodrome, alternates, and estimated off-block time go

&lt;/fx:departure&gt;

&lt;fx:filed&gt;

&lt;!-- The route trajectory for the flight is shown here. It can
contain climb and descent schedules and profiles, 0 to 2000 elements,
route information, and take-off weight --&gt;

&lt;fx:element&gt;

&lt;!-- Each element contains information pertinent to a single point in
the trajectory, such as distance, constraints, enroute delays, route
changes, name of the point this element represents, and the name (if
any) of the route along which the flight will proceed to the next
element --&gt;

&lt;/fx:element&gt;

&lt;fx:routeInformation&gt;

&lt;!-- Contains the route text where available, cruising level and
speed, estimated elapsed time. --&gt;

&lt;/fx:routeInformation&gt;

&lt;/fx:filed&gt;

&lt;fx:flightIdentification&gt;

&lt;!-- The aircraft ID/call sign/tail number by which this flight is
identified by air traffic services --&gt;

&lt;/fx:flightIdentification&gt;

correlated different transactions for this flight --&gt;

&lt;/fx:gufi&gt;

&lt;/mesg:flight&gt;

&lt;/mesg:Message&gt;

The sample messages were generated in three groups, described in the
following sections.

*Note: As of the publication date of this document, the specific
technical vision for the global FF-ICE/1 implementation is still under
discussion by ICAO ATMRPP. While FIXM achieves global harmonisation of
the flight information exchanged by FF-ICE services, it is not yet
decided whether particular aspects related to FF-ICE services
implementation, such as Messaging, should be subject to global
harmonisation.*

*The samples below rely on the Messaging package of FIXM 4.1.0. This
package has been intentionally deprecated by [Change Request
28](https://ost.eurocontrol.int/sites/FIXM/Change%20Requests/Deprecating_the_Messaging_package.docx)
as a signal to FIXM implementers that its use is not necessarily
recommended for global use for the time being, considering the
uncertainties with regards to the desired level of standardization for
FF-ICE and the declared scope of FIXM as outlined in the FIXM Strategy
v1.1, chapter 3. Nevertheless, these samples represent a valid approach
for encoding FF-ICE/1 and/or ATS messages with FIXM-based content. Other
message encodings having FIXM-based content satisfying the requirements
outlined in chapter 2.2 may equally qualify as a valid usage of FIXM.*

FIXM Samples of Uncorrelated ATS Messages
-----------------------------------------

The initial set of samples contained FIXM representation of multiple
messages of types Flight Plan (FPL), Change (CHG), Delay (DLA), and
Cancel (CNL). These are uncorrelated messages, in the sense that they
are not based on one or several particular flights, and each one is
interpreted individually.

The input data for the samples was “sanitized” to not show actual flight
IDs, airline codes, or pilot names. In addition, they do not contain any
references to any other messages in the set.

FIXM Samples of ATS Messages for a Full Flight Life-Cycle 
---------------------------------------------------------

To further expand the sample data, a complete life-cycle set of messages
was constructed for a single flight (DAL18). This approach allowed the
use of most of the ATS message types in a realistic scenario. This data
contained message header input and additional subfields in ATS message
field 3, *message number* and *reference data* (see Field Type 3,
Appendix 3, ICAO Doc 4444), not seen in the earlier samples. These
fields indicate which ATS computers generated and/or exchanged the
messages, and point back to the relevant message when providing response
or follow-up. The field mesg:referenceMessage contains the message uuid
of its associated message, both of which are in the Messaging part of
the FIXM XML.

The scenario which the DAL18 messages illustrate is as follows:

-   DAL18 is a transatlantic flight flying from Detroit (DTW), Michigan
    to London Heathrow (EGGL).

-   The flight departs from Cleveland Center (KZOB), flies through
    Canadian airspace (CZYZ, …), through oceanic airspace (CZQX, EGGX)
    and arrives at the London Air Traffic Control Center (EGTT).

-   The input messages are in ICAO ATS format. They include both
    messages between the airline and ATS facilities, and between ATS
    facilities.

-   The messages contain meta-data comprised of AFTN send and receiving
    addresses along with the day and time of the message. To eliminate
    redundancy, only one or two of each type of message is shown.

*Note: The first two lines of each message (starting with “FF”) are
header data indicating message time and senders and recipients of the
message. The body of the ATS message is contained within parentheses.*

An explanation of the message sequence follows (each message below
corresponds to a sample FIXM message):

1.  The operator, Delta Airlines, files the <u>initial flight plan</u>
    message <u>(FPL)</u> to KZOB, which is the departure center. This
    message is incorrect with regard to the flight’s route information
    (a “0” was placed in the unit of measure field for the airspeed in
    the Route Designator Field Type 15). A rejection message (rather
    than an ACK) is generated in response to this message because of the
    incorrect unit of measure. The rejection message is not shown.
    *Note: This is not something expected to happen in reality, but is
    an artificial case created to illustrate a logical reject of a
    message.*

FIXM Samples of 4DT Data
------------------------

A key component of FIXM is the ability to express a four-dimensional
trajectory (4DT). Since no 4DTs are available in sample ATS messages, a
small set of data representing 4DTs for three flights was converted to
FIXM. This set was comprised of three “Creation Request” messages. These
were used to create “Electronic Flight Plan” (eFPL) messages, which
correspond to converted FPL messages with 4DT data merged into them. The
4DT data includes climb profile, descent profile, and desired
trajectory. The trajectory data includes position, time, altitude,
speed, and weather data associated with each trajectory element.

The FIXM data was generated using both the provided 4DT data and the
route text, parsed into route elements, and merged together into a
logical sequence. However, not every 4DT point corresponded to a route
element, and not every route element had a corresponding 4DT data point.
As a result, the FIXM trajectory contains a logical sequence of
trajectory elements, with some of the trajectory elements containing
associated 4DT data and some not. While this may not represent how an
ideal 4DT message would appear if originally generated in FIXM format,
it does produce a logical result that is FIXM compliant.

How to create an Application Library
====================================

Initial Download and Setup
--------------------------

To save time and reduce setup steps, it is recommended that you begin
the process of creating your Application by downloading the FIXM Basic
Message v1.0.0 full release[14].

1.  Download the full release of FIXM Basic Message v1.0.0 from
    <https://fixm.aero/releases/Basic-Msg-1.0.0/FIXM_Basic_Message_v1.0.0_with_Core_v4.2.0_full_archive.zip>.

2.  Unzip the full release and navigate to the “applications” directory
    under “schemas”.

3.  Delete the “basicmessage” directory.

4.  Navigate to the “uml” directory.

5.  Rename the .eap file to something appropriate for your Application.

For this guided example, the .eap file was renamed to
“FIXM\_Example\_Message\_v1.0.0\_with\_Core\_v4.2.0.eap”. The starting
directory structure of the example environment is shown below.

<img src="media/image52.png" style="width:3.12544in;height:3.77136in" />

1.  Open the model (the .eap file) with Sparx Enterprise Architect[15]
    (EA).

2.  Click the arrow
    \[<img src="media/image53.png" style="width:0.14585in;height:0.14585in" />\]
    next to Applications in Project Browser to expand the Applications
    container.

3.  Right click on the BasicMessage package in Project Browser and
    choose “Delete ‘&lt;&lt;XSDschema&gt;&gt; BasicMessage’”.

<img src="media/image54.png" style="width:3.27083in;height:4.19591in" />

1.  Click the Yes button to confirm the deletion.

<img src="media/image55.png" style="width:3.76094in;height:1.85443in" />

Create an Application Package
-----------------------------

For this example, we created a very simple Application that focuses on
arrival and departure alerts. It includes Application header fields for
message sender, recipient(s), timestamp, and alert type along with two
templates, one for arrival alerts and one for departure alerts.

1.  Right click on the Applications container and choose “Add a
    Package…”.

<img src="media/image56.png" style="width:3.09861in;height:5.13542in" />

1.  In the New Package dialogue box, change the *Name* field to
    something appropriate for your Application (in this example,
    “ExampleMessage”).

2.  Select the *Create Diagram* radio button.

3.  Then click OK.

<img src="media/image57.png" style="width:3.71927in;height:2.96916in" />

1.  This will bring up a New Diagram dialogue box. In the *Type*
    section:

    1.  Choose “UML Structural” under *Select From*.

    2.  Choose “Class” under *Diagram Types*.

> Click OK to create the Application package and its associated
> diagram[16].
>
> <img src="media/image58.png" style="width:6.5in;height:4.83264in" />

### Apply Schema Stereotype

In order to generate XSD schemas in Sparx EA, each package that
corresponds to a schema file needs an XSDschema stereotype applied to
it. To add an XSDschema stereotype to your package:

1.  Double click (or right click and choose “Properties…”) on your
    Application package (here called “ExampleMessage”) in Project
    Browser to open the Package dialogue box.

2.  In the newly opened Package dialogue box, click on the “…” box next
    to *Stereotype* (near the top right corner) to open the Stereotype
    dialogue box.

3.  In the newly opened Stereotype dialogue box, select “XSDschema” and
    then click OK.

4.  Then click OK in the Package dialogue box to apply the stereotype.

<img src="media/image59.png" style="width:6.5in;height:3.97778in" />

### Set Up Schema Properties

Once the stereotype is applied, you can configure your schema
properties, setting up a number of XSD details such as schema file name,
schema namespace, namespace prefixes, etc.

1.  Once again, double click (or right click and choose “Properties…”)
    on your Application package in Project Browser. With the XSDschema
    stereotype applied, this should now open an XSD schema Properties
    dialogue box.

<img src="media/image60.png" style="width:5.20906in;height:3.39631in" />

1.  Fill in values for your schema properties as appropriate for your
    Application. In this example, we used the following values:

    1.  *Target Namespace* set to:
        “http://www.fixm.aero/app/example/1.0”[17].

    2.  *Prefix* set to: “xmg”[18].

2.  You must also fill in the *Schema File* field with the path to your
    application directory and an appropriate file name. In this example,
    the following *Schema File* entry was used:
    .\\schemas\\applications\\examplemessage\\ExampleMessage.xsd.

> <u>IMPORTANT NOTE</u>: Sparx EA will not automatically create any of
> the directories for the path to the file specified in the *Schema
> File* field. **They must be created outside of Sparx EA before
> generating the schemas.** FIXM is natively set up to generate its
> schema files under a directory named “schemas” that is located in the
> same directory as the Sparx EA file. To save time, rather than
> creating all of the directories needed by hand, you can instead:

1.  Copy the “schemas” directory you modified back in [Initial Download
    and Setup](#initial-download-and-setup) into the directory where
    your Sparx EA file is located (in this example, the “uml”
    directory).

2.  Under the “applications” directory beneath the “schemas” directory,
    add another directory with a name appropriate for your Application
    (here “examplemessage” was used).

> In this example, this new “schemas” directory was added to the “uml”
> directory and was structured as shown below.

<img src="media/image61.png" style="width:2.18781in;height:3.02126in" />

1.  With all of these fields filled out, your XSD schema Properties
    dialogue box should look something like below. Click OK to save
    these settings.

<img src="media/image62.png" style="width:5.19864in;height:3.39631in" />

### Add Schema Description and Tags

The final step in setting up your schema details is to add a description
for your package and adjust the schema configuration settings that are
controlled in Sparx EA via tagged values.

1.  Once more, double click (or right click and choose “Properties…”) on
    your Application package in Project Browser and then click the UML
    button (near the top right corner). This will bring you back to your
    Package dialogue box.

2.  In the central text box, fill in a description of your Application
    package. The text entered here will also show up as a documentation
    element in your schema file.

3.  Next, click on the *Tags* tab (near the lower right hand corner) to
    add three tags used by Sparx EA when creating your schema files:
    attributeFormDefault, elementFormDefault, and version.

    1.  FIXM standardly sets attributeFormDefault to “unqualified”.

    2.  FIXM standardly sets elementFormDefault to “qualified”.

    3.  Version should be set as appropriate for your Application
        (“1.0.0” in this example).

> To add these tags, click on the third icon from the left
> \[<img src="media/image63.png" style="width:0.19001in;height:0.15347in" />\]
> in the *Tags* tab and fill in the *Tag* and *Value* fields similar to
> what is shown below.
>
> <img src="media/image64.png" style="width:3.76094in;height:1.81275in" />
>
> <img src="media/image65.png" style="width:3.76094in;height:1.81275in" />
>
> <img src="media/image66.png" style="width:3.76094in;height:1.80233in" />

1.  When finished, your Package dialogue box will look something like
    below. Click OK to save these settings.

<img src="media/image67.png" style="width:6.5in;height:3.98056in" />

Create Application Content
--------------------------

Now it is time to create any content needed for your Application. For
this example, we created two classes: a complex type for the message
itself and an enumeration for the alert type. The message had three
attributes added to it and the enumeration was linked to the message via
an association. We also added an association to link the message to
Core’s Flight class (the root class for Core). Finally, we created a
root element for the Application.

1.  Double click on your Application’s diagram (or right click it and
    choose “Open”) to get started.

### Create a ComplexType Class

We will start by creating a class with the XSDcomplexType stereotype for
our message.

1.  In Toolbox, click on “Complex Type” and then click anywhere in the
    diagram section of the screen. This will open up an XSD complexType
    Properties dialogue box.

2.  Add an appropriate *Name* and *Annotation* for your new class.

3.  Then click OK.

<img src="media/image68.png" style="width:1.43431in;height:3.464in" /><img src="media/image69.png" style="width:4.63542in;height:3.48841in" />

You can now begin to add content to your class.

### Add an Attribute to a Class

We added three attributes to this class: sender, recipient, and
timestamp. Because each of these is of a type defined in Core’s Base
package, using attributes is in line with how FIXM is standardly
modeled.

1.  Right click on the class in the diagram and choose “Features and
    Properties” and then “Attributes…”. This opens the Features dialogue
    box. In the Features dialogue box, you can add the attributes needed
    for your Application to your class.

<img src="media/image70.png" style="width:4.11265in;height:3.80508in" />

1.  Begin by clicking where it says “New Attribute…” under *Name* and
    filling in your new field’s name. In this example, we started with
    “sender”.

2.  Then hit the tab key or otherwise click out of the *Name* field.

3.  You should now have a new attribute added to your class with a
    default *Type* of int and *Scope* of Private.

<img src="media/image71.png" style="width:6.5in;height:3.4125in" />

1.  Next, click on the *Type* field, select the down arrow on the right
    side, and then click “Select Type…”.

<img src="media/image72.png" style="width:2.417in;height:2.11488in" />

1.  This opens the Select Type dialogue box. Navigate to the appropriate
    class in the Base package you want to use, select it, and then click
    OK. In this example, that was Fixm -&gt; Core -&gt; Base -&gt;
    Organization -&gt; PersonOrOrganization.

<img src="media/image73.png" style="width:6.49049in;height:4.85484in" />

1.  Next change the *Scope* field to “Public”.

2.  Adjust the *Multiplicity* in the *Attribute* section as needed (in
    this example, it was set to 0..1).

3.  Then add a description for the field in the *Notes* section. When
    finished, your Features dialogue box will look something like below.

<img src="media/image74.png" style="width:6.5in;height:3.89306in" />

1.  Repeat the steps above to continue adding as many attributes as
    desired. For this example, we also added:

    1.  A recipient field:

        1.  *Name* set to: “recipient”.

        2.  *Type* set to: “Fixm -&gt; Core -&gt; Base -&gt;
            Organization -&gt; PersonOrOrganization”

        3.  *Multiplicity* set to: “0..2000”.

    2.  A timestamp field:

        1.  *Name* set to: “timestamp”.

        2.  *Type* set to: “Fixm -&gt; Core -&gt; Base -&gt; Types -&gt;
            Time”.

        3.  *Multiplicity* set to: “0..1”.

2.  When finished, click Close on the Features dialogue box. The class
    diagram should display the name, type, and multiplicity of each
    attribute added to the class.

<img src="media/image75.png" style="width:2.39617in;height:0.95847in" />

### Create an Enumeration Class

Next, we will create an enumeration class to represent the type of the
alert.

1.  In Toolbox, click on “Enum” and then click anywhere in the diagram
    section of the screen. This will open up an XSD enumeration
    Properties dialogue box.

2.  Add an appropriate *Name*, comma-delimited set of *Values*, and
    *Annotation* for your new class. For the *Type* field, FIXM
    standardly leaves this blank. When generating schemas, the physical
    model will still derive this enumeration from xs:string but leaving
    the field blank avoids displaying the string inheritance in the
    model diagrams.

3.  Then click OK.

<img src="media/image76.png" style="width:5.14655in;height:3.88596in" />

1.  Right click on the enumeration class in the diagram and choose
    “Features and Properties” and then “Attributes…”. This opens the
    Features dialogue box.

<img src="media/image77.png" style="width:5.03121in;height:4.17708in" />

1.  In the Features dialogue box, you can add descriptions to each
    enumeration in the *Notes* tab. When finished, click OK.

<img src="media/image78.png" style="width:6.5in;height:3.875in" />

### Add an Association Between Classes

When converted to XSD schemas, there is no difference between
representing a field as an attribute of a class versus representing a
field as an association between two classes. However, FIXM standardly
only uses attributes for fields of a type defined in Core’s Base
package. Any other classes you want to use as a field under a class
should be attached to the class via an association.

In this example, we used an association to create the alert type field
needed for our message because our AlertType enumeration was not defined
under the Base package.

1.  Click on the class you wish to add your field to. You will see an
    upward arrow icon
    \[<img src="media/image79.png" style="width:0.10156in;height:0.15625in" />\]
    appear near the upper right hand corner of your class.

<img src="media/image80.png" style="width:2.77122in;height:1.11474in" />

1.  Click on this arrow and drag it over the class you wish to use as
    the type of your field. Then release the mouse button and choose
    “Association” from the list of options that pops up.

<img src="media/image81.png" style="width:3.08376in;height:3.83387in" />

1.  This will create an association between the two classes.

<img src="media/image82.png" style="width:2.40659in;height:2.37533in" />

1.  Double click (or right click and choose “Properties…”) on the
    association to open the Association Properties dialogue box.

2.  Begin by clicking on the far right side of the *Direction* field
    under the *Connector Properties* table of the *Main* tab on the
    right hand side of the dialogue box. This should open a dropdown
    menu. From this menu, choose “Source -&gt; Destination”.

<img src="media/image83.png" style="width:6.5in;height:4.10833in" />

1.  Next, select “Role(s)” from the tree of options in the upper left
    hand corner. This brings up a new section of the Association
    Properties dialogue box split between setting up details for the
    source and target sides of your new association.

<img src="media/image84.png" style="width:6.5in;height:4.11111in" />

1.  In the text/dropdown box directly under TARGET in the upper right
    hand corner, type in the name you would like to use for the field
    represented by this association (“type” in this example).

2.  In the next text box down, fill in a short description for this
    field.

3.  Finally, choose an appropriate *Multiplicity* for this field (“0..1”
    in this example).

4.  When finished, your Association Properties dialogue box will look
    something like below. Click OK to save these settings.

<img src="media/image85.png" style="width:6.5in;height:4.12083in" />

In this example, we also added an association between ExampleMessage and
the Flight class (the root class of FIXM Core).

1.  To accomplish this, first navigate to the correct package in Project
    Browser (Fixm -&gt; Core -&gt; Flight -&gt; FlightData) and then
    select the “&lt;&lt;XSDcomplexType&gt;&gt;Flight” class.

<img src="media/image86.png" style="width:3.36505in;height:5.04237in" />

1.  Now click and drag the Flight class from Project Browser to the
    ExampleMessage diagram. When you release the mouse button, a
    dialogue box will appear asking you how you would like to paste the
    class into the diagram. Select “Link” under the *Drop As* dropdown
    box and then click Okay.

<img src="media/image87.png" style="width:3.77136in;height:2.0107in" />

1.  Next, follow the same steps detailed above to create an association
    from the ExampleMessage class to the Flight class. When finished,
    your diagram should look something like below.

<img src="media/image88.png" style="width:6.04251in;height:2.68788in" />

The final step in creating associations is to add “position” tags. Sparx
EA will automatically alphabetize class attributes when creating schemas
from the logical model but associations need to be handled explicitly.
Once all associations have been created for a class, follow the steps
below to make sure the fields derived from associations are properly
ordered in the physical model.

1.  In the *Start* ribbon at the top of the screen, select “Tagged
    Values” from the *Windows* section to open the Tagged Value window.
    Having this window open provides a shortcut to accessing tagged
    values and is very useful when adding position tags.

<img src="media/image89.png" style="width:2.68788in;height:0.96889in" />

1.  Next, determine the correct ordering for each association
    originating from your class. For this example, the ExampleMessage
    class had three attributes and two associations. Ordering the group
    of fields as a whole alphabetically gives you: flight, recipient,
    sender, timestamp, type. The position of the field in this
    alphabetical list gives you the value (starting with “1” for the
    first field) needed when adding a position tag. So, for this
    example, “flight” needed a position tag with a value of “1” and
    “type” needed a position tag with a value of “5”.

2.  Now, click on each association in turn. When clicked on, you will
    see all the tagged values associated with whatever you click on show
    up in the Tagged Values window. For these associations, this window
    will initially look like the image below.

<img src="media/image90.png" style="width:4.17767in;height:4.15683in" />

1.  Click on *Connector Source* and then click on the third icon from
    the left
    \[<img src="media/image63.png" style="width:0.19001in;height:0.15347in" />\]
    to add a new tagged value. The *tag* field should be set to
    “position” and the *value* field to the correct numeric value as
    determined above. In this example, the flight association,
    connecting ExampleMessage to Flight, was given the following tag:

> <img src="media/image91.png" style="width:3.54167in;height:1.69601in" />
> <img src="media/image92.png" style="width:3.53125in;height:3.52247in" />
>
> The type association, connecting ExampleMessage to AlertType, was set
> up as below:
>
> <img src="media/image93.png" style="width:3.52083in;height:1.67141in" />
>
> <img src="media/image94.png" style="width:3.48958in;height:3.48958in" />

### Add a Root Element

Each XML document has exactly one single root element. It encloses all
the other elements and is therefore the sole parent element to all the
other elements. Applications create one or more elements that serve as
an entry point to the model and can therefore be used as root elements.
For this example, we created a single such entry point named
“ExampleMessage”.

1.  In Toolbox, click on “Element” and then click anywhere in the
    diagram section of the screen. This will open up an XSD element
    Properties dialogue box.

2.  Add an appropriate *Name* (in this example, “ExampleMessage”) and
    *Annotation* (in this example, “The ExampleMessage element is an
    entry point to the Example Message application.”) for your
    Application.

<img src="media/image95.png" style="width:5.27157in;height:4.07349in" />

1.  Next click on the “…” icon to the right of the *Type* field. This
    opens the Select Classifier dialogue box. In the *Browse* tab,
    navigate to and click on the class you would like to use as the
    entry point for your Application. In this example, Fixm -&gt;
    Applications -&gt; ExampleMessage -&gt; MessageType. Click OK.

<img src="media/image96.png" style="width:6.45923in;height:4.84443in" />

1.  The *Type* field should now be updated to your selection. Click OK
    to create your root element. Note the generalization link formed
    between the element and the class it is based on.

<img src="media/image97.png" style="width:6.5in;height:2.17222in" />

Repeat the steps above to add elements for each intended entry point
into your Application.

1.  Continue adding as many classes, attributes, associations, and
    elements as needed for your particular Application. When finished,
    right click on the name at the top of the diagram and click “Save
    Changes to ‘\[diagram name\]’”.

<img src="media/image98.png" style="width:4.18808in;height:2.22948in" />

The Application presented here is simple but keep in mind that the steps
detailed in this guide can be used to create as many packages and as
much content as needed to capture all the structure, headers, and
metadata needed for your particular exchange.

Create Templates
----------------

FIXM is a general-purpose standard meant to facilitate the exchange of
any and all flight data. To accomplish this, it must be extremely
flexible in terms of required data content. However, individual users of
the FIXM standard may want to lockdown the expected format of their data
to reflect the content requirements of their particular message
exchanges. Message templates, created via XSD restrictions, is the
current method recommended by FIXM to accomplish this goal. For this
example, we created two templates to illustrate the process: departure
alerts and arrival alerts.

### Create an Overall Template Container

The steps for creating this package are largely identical to those
outlined in [Create an Application
Package](#create-an-application-package) above. Key differences are
noted below.

1.  Begin by right clicking on your Application package and choose “Add
    a Package…”.

<img src="media/image99.png" style="width:4.16in;height:5.04in" />

1.  In the New Package dialogue box, change the *Name* field to
    something appropriate to your templates (here we used
    “ExampleTemplates”), select the *Package Only* radio button, and
    then click OK.

<img src="media/image100.png" style="width:3.70885in;height:2.97958in" />

1.  Apply a schema stereotype and begin setting up schema properties as
    outlined in [Apply Schema Stereotype](#apply-schema-stereotype) and
    [Set Up Schema Properties](#set-up-schema-properties) above using
    the same *Target Namespace* and *Prefix* as was used for your
    Application package[19].

<img src="media/image101.png" style="width:5.21948in;height:3.39631in" />

1.  For the *Schema File* field, choose something appropriate for your
    templates (in this example,
    “.\\schemas\\applications\\examplemessage\\exampletemplates\\ExampleTemplates.xsd”).
    Please note, you will want to create a new subdirectory under your
    Application’s directory to hold the templates (in this example,
    “exampletemplates” was created below the “examplemessage”
    directory).

<img src="media/image102.png" style="width:2.03153in;height:0.7501in" />

1.  In some cases, Sparx EA will automatically add additional namespace
    prefixes for packages that need to be imported, but that does not
    happen in this instance. Address this by manually adding the
    namespaces of any packages you will import. This step is
    accomplished by:

<!-- -->

1.  Clicking “New” to open a Namespace Details dialogue box.

2.  Filling in appropriate details for each namespace to be included.

3.  Then clicking OK.

>
> <img src="media/image104.png" style="width:4.14641in;height:1.46895in" />

1.  At this point, your XSD schema Properties dialogue box should look
    something like below. Click OK to save these settings.

<img src="media/image105.png" style="width:5.17781in;height:3.39631in" />

1.  Finally, follow the steps outlined in [Add Schema Description and
    Tags](#add-schema-description-and-tags) to complete the setup of
    your template container.

### Create a Container for each Type of Message Template

With the overall template container built, you must now create
individual containers for each message template you wish to include in
your exchange. In this example, we created two such containers:
ArrivalAlert and DepartureAlert. Due to their similarity in structure to
the overall container, we can use a shortcut to build them rather than
repeating all the steps from the previous section.

1.  Right click on your newly created template container in Project
    Browser and choose “Copy / Paste” and then “Copy to Clipboard” and
    then “Full Structure of Duplication”.

<img src="media/image106.png" style="width:6.5in;height:4.56736in" />

1.  Once again, right click on your template container in Project
    Browser and this time choose “Copy / Paste” and then “Paste Package
    from Clipboard”.

<img src="media/image107.png" style="width:6.5in;height:5.73333in" />

1.  You should see a new copy of your container show up in Project
    Browser below the original.

<img src="media/image108.png" style="width:3.37547in;height:5.06321in" />

1.  Repeat the above “Paste Package from Clipboard” step for each
    message template you would like to create. In this example, we
    created two message templates. When finished, your Project Browser
    should display something similar to below.

<img src="media/image109.png" style="width:3.7922in;height:5.06321in" />

1.  Double click (or right click and choose “Properties…”) on each
    individual message template container and modify the *Schema Name*
    and *Schema File* fields to be something appropriate for your
    templates. Outside of Sparx EA, you will also want to create
    individual directories below the overall template directory to hold
    each message template. For this example, the following values were
    used:

    1.  ArrivalAlert template

        1.  *Schema Name* set to: “ArrivalAlert”

        2.  *Schema File* set to:
            > “.\\schemas\\applications\\examplemessage\\exampletemplates\\arrivalalert\\ArrivalAlert.xsd”

    2.  DepartureAlert template

        1.  *Schema Name* set to: “DepartureAlert”

        2.  *Schema File* set to:
            > “.\\schemas\\applications\\examplemessage\\exampletemplates\\departurealert\\DepartureAlert.xsd”

> And the schemas directory structure was modified as follows:

<img src="media/image110.png" style="width:2.05237in;height:1.10432in" />

> Don’t forget to modify your schema descriptions to something
> appropriate as well. In this example, ArrivalAlert used “An example
> Arrival Alert template.” and DepartureAlert used “An example Departure
> Alert template”.

1.  When finished, your Project Browser should display something similar
    to below.

<img src="media/image111.png" style="width:3.41714in;height:5.02153in" />

### Create a Message Template

The individual message templates themselves recreate the structure of
the portions of the models that they draw fields from and reuse the same
namespaces, prefixes, and package names. They use different diagram
names, schema file names, schema descriptions, and, of course, the
content itself is modified using XSD restrictions.

The convention used so far in FIXM when naming template material is to
prefix the existing names with text to identify the Application followed
by text to identify the particular message. So, for this example, fields
under ArrivalAlert were prefixed with “ExampleAA\_” while fields under
DepartureAlert were prefixed with “ExampleDA\_”.

#### Create Template Packages

The template packages should replicate all the settings of the package
they correspond to except for their diagram’s *Name* field (if they have
an associated diagram – some packages won’t), the schema description,
and the *Schema File* field of their schema properties.

1.  Follow the steps outlined in [Create an Application
    Package](#create-an-application-package) to recreate, under your
    message template container, the packages you wish to restrict in
    your template. All names, properties, descriptions, tags, etc.,
    should be the same[20] except:

    1.  If your package has an associated diagram, change the diagram
        *Name* to include your template’s prefix. While not strictly
        necessary, this helps prevent confusing template diagrams with
        the originals.

    2.  Change the *Schema File* field to use a path corresponding to
        your message template and a filename beginning with your
        template’s prefix. Template schema files should be located under
        the directory of your message container but their paths should
        otherwise include creating any intermediate directories, etc.,
        so that they are structured similar to the paths to the files
        they are restricting.

    3.  Indicate that the schema is a template in the description text.

For this example, we first created a template package corresponding to
ExampleMessage under ArrivalAlert. When creating the package, we changed
its diagram name to be “ExampleAA\_ExampleMessage”.

<img src="media/image112.png" style="width:6.5in;height:4.81736in" />

<img src="media/image113.png" style="width:3.6776in;height:5.05279in" />

When configuring the package, we used all the same values as
ExampleMessage except changing the schema description to “An example
Arrival Alert message template for the ExampleMessage package.” and the
*Schema File* field to use
“.\\schemas\\applications\\examplemessage\\exampletemplates\\arrivalalert\\examplemessage\\ExampleAA\_ExampleMessage.xsd”.

<img src="media/image114.png" style="width:5.20906in;height:3.38589in" />

<img src="media/image115.png" style="width:6.5in;height:3.97778in" />

The same steps were used to create template packages for Core’s Flight
package and Arrival and FlightData sub-packages. When finished, Package
Browser appeared as follows.

<img src="media/image116.png" style="width:3.70885in;height:5.04237in" />

And the directory structure for the Application was organized as shown
below.

<img src="media/image117.png" style="width:2.37533in;height:1.85443in" />

#### Create Template Content

The root mechanism for creating template content is making use of the
“XSDrestriction” stereotype built into Sparx EA. When applied to a
Generalization connector between two classes, this results in a schema
restriction on the simpleType or complexContent definition, depending on
the nature of the classes, of the derived class in the physical model.
Put simply, these XSD restrictions allow you to create derived classes
with fewer fields and/or more restricted content than the classes they
are derived from.

We will illustrate in more detail how these restrictions are applied by
looking first at how the ArrivalAlert template was constructed. When
finished, this template provided the following fields:

-   1 ExampleMessage with:

    -   1 sender

    -   1..99 recipients

    -   1 timestamp

    -   1 type (set to ARRIVAL)

    -   1 flight with:

        -   1 arrival with:

            -   1 actualTimeOfArrival

            -   1 arrivalAerodrome

        -   1 gufi

        -   1 flightIdentification with:

            -   1 aircraftIdentification

        -   0..1 flightType

When constructing a template, we found it easiest to start at the leaf
(outermost) fields and work backwards to the root (innermost) fields.

##### Create a Restricted Class (Complex Type)

1.  Double click on your message template’s diagram (or right click it
    and choose “Open”) to get started. In this example, we began with
    the “ExampeAA\_Arrival” diagram.

2.  Locate the class you wish to restrict in Project Browser and then
    left click and drag the class into your diagram (in this example,
    Fixm -&gt; Core -&gt; Flight -&gt; Arrival -&gt;
    &lt;&lt;XSDcomplexType&gt;&gt;Arrival). Select “Link” under the
    *Drop As* dropdown box and then click Okay.

<img src="media/image118.png" style="width:3.75052in;height:2.02112in" />

1.  Create a new class of the same type as the class you wish to
    restrict. In this example, that would be a complexType class,
    created as outlined in [Create a ComplexType
    Class](#create-a-complextype-class). The *Name* and *Annotation*
    should be the same as the class you are restricting except the
    *Name* should begin with your template’s prefix.

<img src="media/image119.png" style="width:5.09446in;height:3.83387in" />

1.  Click on your new restricted class in the diagram. You will see an
    upward arrow icon
    \[<img src="media/image79.png" style="width:0.10156in;height:0.15625in" />\]
    appear near the upper right hand corner of the class. Click on this
    arrow and drag it over the class you are restricting. Then release
    the mouse button and choose “Generalization” from the list of
    options that pops up.

<img src="media/image120.png" style="width:4.89652in;height:3.36505in" />

<img src="media/image121.png" style="width:3.3338in;height:3.30254in" />

1.  Double click (or right click and choose “Properties…”) on the
    generalization connector to open the Generalization Properties
    dialogue box.

2.  Click on the far right side of the *Stereotype* field under the
    *Connector Properties* table of the *Main* tab on the right hand
    side of the dialogue box. This should open a Stereotype dialogue
    box. Check the box next to “XSDrestriction” and click Okay.

<img src="media/image122.png" style="width:6.5in;height:4.30278in" />

1.  Then click Okay in the Generalization Properties dialogue box to
    apply the stereotype.

<img src="media/image123.png" style="width:3.31296in;height:3.30254in" />

Any class attributes and associations that resolve to XML elements in
the physical model that are not included in a restricted class will be
removed[21]. At this point, our example restricted class was completely
empty. The next step is to add back in the attributes and associations
you wish to retain.

##### Set Up Restricted Class Attributes (Complex Type)

We will begin with class attributes. If desired, attributes can be added
by following the steps listed in [Add an Attribute to a
Class](#add-an-attribute-to-a-class), being sure to replicate the values
used by the attributes in the class you are restricting. However, the
steps listed below can be used as a shortcut that should make adding the
attributes both easier and less error prone.

1.  Once again, locate the class you wish to restrict in Project Browser
    (in this example, Fixm -&gt; Core -&gt; Flight -&gt; Arrival -&gt;
    &lt;&lt;XSDcomplexType&gt;&gt;Arrival). Click on the arrow
    \[<img src="media/image124.png" style="width:0.12502in;height:0.16669in" />\]
    to the left of the class to display its associated attributes.

<img src="media/image125.png" style="width:3.94847in;height:5.06321in" />

1.  Control-left-click on each attribute you wish to retain in your
    restriction. In this example, “actualTimeOfArrival” and
    “arrivalAerodrome”.

<img src="media/image126.png" style="width:3.93805in;height:5.03195in" />

1.  Now drag the selected attributes onto your restricted class in the
    diagram. In the example, the attributes were dragged onto the
    ExampleAA\_Arrival class in the ExampleAA\_Arrival diagram. This
    will create exact replicas of the attributes within your restricted
    class.

<img src="media/image127.png" style="width:3.32338in;height:3.17753in" />

Next, adjust the *Multiplicity* of your attributes to suit your
template’s needs.

1.  Right click on the restricted class in the diagram and choose
    “Features and Properties” and then “Attributes…”. Select the
    attribute you wish to adjust and then click on *Multiplicity* in the
    *Attribute* section to change its value. In this example, both
    “actualTimeOfArrival” and “arrivalAerodrome” were given an upper and
    lower bound of “1”.

<img src="media/image128.png" style="width:6.5in;height:3.89028in" />

Most attributes in FIXM Core are marked as nillable. This is done via
adding a tag to the field with *Tag* set to “nillable” and *Value* set
to “true”.

<img src="media/image129.png" style="width:6.5in;height:3.87847in" />

1.  If you do not wish attributes in your template to be nillable,
    navigate to the *Tagged Values* tab, and then erase the nillable tag
    by clicking on it and then clicking the fifth icon from the left
    \[<img src="media/image130.png" style="width:0.15417in;height:0.14646in" />\].
    In this example, the nillable tags were erased from all attributes
    with a multiplicity lower bound of “1” or higher.

<img src="media/image131.png" style="width:6.5in;height:3.875in" />

1.  Click Close when finished. You should see the new multiplicities
    reflected in the restricted class diagram.

<img src="media/image132.png" style="width:3.32338in;height:3.16711in" />

##### Set Up Restricted Class Associations

Next, we will focus on setting up associations. Like attributes, any
associations that resolve to XML elements not added back to your
restricted class will be removed. For example, the “reclearanceInFlight”
association attached to Core’s Arrival class (shown below) was removed
from ExampleAA\_Arrival because the association was never recreated.

<img src="media/image133.png" style="width:4.1985in;height:3.08376in" />

To find an example of retained associations, let us move on to the
restricted FlightData package.

Following the steps outlined so far in [Create Template
Content](#create-template-content), we created restricted versions of
the “Flight” and “FlightIdentification” classes from Fixm -&gt; Core
-&gt; Flight -&gt; FlightData in the ExampleAA\_FlightData diagram. For
our new “ExampleAA\_Flight” class, the “gufi” attribute was retained and
made required (*Multiplicity* of 1..1). For
“ExampleAA\_FlightIdentification”, the “aircraftIdentification”
attribute was retained and made required. Below are examples of how
Project Brower and the diagram appeared after this was done.

<img src="media/image134.png" style="width:5.13613in;height:5.04237in" />

<img src="media/image135.png" style="width:6.5in;height:2.62847in" />

Much like “reclearanceInFlight” from the Arrival package, all of the
associations attached to the Flight class in Core have been implicitly
restricted away for ExampleAA\_Flight. To retain them, they must be
added back in by hand.

In this example, the first association we added back in was
“flightType”.

1.  If the class you wish to add an association to is not already
    present in the diagram, locate it in Project Brower and drag it into
    the diagram. In this example, “Fixm -&gt; Core -&gt; Flight -&gt;
    FlightData -&gt; TypeOfFlight” was added to the
    ExampleAA\_FlightData diagram.

<img src="media/image136.png" style="width:6.5in;height:2.43056in" />

1.  Use the steps detailed in [Add an Association Between
    Classes](#add-an-association-between-classes) to create the
    association desired for your restricted class. Like with class
    attributes, you will want to reuse all of the same values as the
    original association with the possible exception of multiplicity and
    removing the nillable tag. You will also likely need to modify the
    “position” tag to make sure your elements are ordered correctly in
    the physical model. In this example, we used all of the same values
    used in the original “flightType” association except position (set
    to “3” in the final version of the template).

<img src="media/image137.png" style="width:6.5in;height:4.10903in" />

<img src="media/image138.png" style="width:6.5in;height:2.45208in" />

Sparx EA automatically displays any associations between classes you add
to a diagram. Above you will notice this for the existing associations
“flightType” and “flightIdentification”. To improve the readability of
your diagrams, it is recommended you hide (not delete[22]) these
associations.

1.  Right click on the any existing associations you do not want to show
    in your diagram and choose “Visibility” and then “Hide Connector”.
    In this example, the pre-existing “flightType” and
    “flightIdentification” associations were hidden.

<img src="media/image139.png" style="width:6.5in;height:5.72708in" />

<img src="media/image140.png" style="width:6.5in;height:2.46319in" />

##### Use a Restricted Class to Enforce the Use of Another Restricted Class

The next association created for the example was used to add back in the
“flightIdentification” field to the restricted ExampleAA\_Flight class.
However, we only wanted to allow the use of the restricted
ExampleAA\_FlightIdentification class, not the original unrestricted
FlightIdentification class from Core.

While doing so is mechanically no different than the steps outlined
above in [Set Up Restricted Class
Associations](#set-up-restricted-class-associations), this chaining
together of restricted classes (ultimately all the way back to the root
class of your Application) is the means by which templates are formed
and enforced[23].

Below are a series of screenshots capturing key steps taken along the
way to completing the restricted FlightData package. Each of these steps
involved enforcing the use of a restricted class.

<img src="media/image141.png" style="width:6.5in;height:4.11875in" />

<img src="media/image142.png" style="width:6.5in;height:2.44931in" />

<img src="media/image143.png" style="width:4.49021in;height:5.03195in" />

<img src="media/image144.png" style="width:3.80261in;height:2.05237in" />

<img src="media/image145.png" style="width:6.5in;height:3.55833in" />

<img src="media/image146.png" style="width:6.5in;height:4.07847in" />

<img src="media/image147.png" style="width:6.5in;height:3.57778in" />

##### Create a Restricted Class (Enumeration)

When creating the final ArrivalAlert restricted package
(ExampleMessage), we run into a new use of XSD restriction: limiting an
enumeration to only allow a specific value.

1.  Similar to [Create a Restricted Class (Complex
    Type)](#create-a-restricted-class-complex-type), begin by dragging
    the enumeration you wish to restrict into your diagram. In this
    example, “AlertType” from Fixm -&gt; Applications -&gt;
    ExampleMessage was added to the “ExampleAA\_ExampleMessage” diagram.

2.  Next, add a new enumeration to the diagram as outlined in [Create an
    Enumeration Class](#create-an-enumeration-class). However, the
    *Name* field should begin with your message template’s prefix (in
    this example, “MessageAA\_”) followed by the same name as the
    enumeration you are restricting, the *Annotation* should be the same
    as the enumeration you are restricting, and the *Values* should only
    include the value you wish to enforce in this template (in this
    example, “ARRIVAL”).

<img src="media/image148.png" style="width:5.15697in;height:3.91721in" />

1.  Next click on the “…” icon to the right of the *Type* field. This
    opens the Select Classifier dialogue box. In the *Browse* tab,
    navigate to and click on the class you would like your restriction
    to be derived from. In this example, Fixm -&gt; Applications -&gt;
    ExampleMessage -&gt; AlertType. Click OK.

<img src="media/image149.png" style="width:6.44882in;height:4.83401in" />

1.  You will see the selected class show up in the *Type* field. Click
    OK to create the enumeration.

<img src="media/image150.png" style="width:5.17781in;height:3.9068in" />

<img src="media/image151.png" style="width:1.31268in;height:2.19822in" />

1.  Finally, as done in [Create a Restricted Class (Complex
    Type)](#create-a-restricted-class-complex-type), apply the
    XSDrestriction stereotype to your generalization connector to finish
    constructing your restricted enumeration class.

<img src="media/image152.png" style="width:1.33352in;height:2.19822in" />

The rest of the restricted ExampleMessage package was created using the
techniques covered in above in [Create Template
Content](#create-template-content). Below are a series of screenshots
capturing key steps taken along the way.

<img src="media/image153.png" style="width:3.38589in;height:5.02153in" />

<img src="media/image154.png" style="width:3.76094in;height:2.03153in" />

<img src="media/image155.png" style="width:5.06321in;height:3.82345in" />

<img src="media/image156.png" style="width:3.87554in;height:1.69815in" />

<img src="media/image157.png" style="width:4.52146in;height:2.28157in" />

<img src="media/image158.png" style="width:3.37547in;height:5.04237in" />

<img src="media/image159.png" style="width:4.38603in;height:2.32324in" />

<img src="media/image160.png" style="width:6.5in;height:3.89583in" />

<img src="media/image161.png" style="width:4.45896in;height:2.34408in" />

<img src="media/image162.png" style="width:6.5in;height:4.05486in" />

<img src="media/image163.png" style="width:4.40686in;height:2.31282in" />

<img src="media/image164.png" style="width:6.5in;height:4.12014in" />

<img src="media/image165.png" style="width:4.53188in;height:2.36491in" />

<img src="media/image166.png" style="width:5.14655in;height:5.03195in" />

<img src="media/image167.png" style="width:3.75052in;height:2.02112in" />

<img src="media/image168.png" style="width:6.5in;height:4.10347in" />

<img src="media/image169.png" style="width:6.5in;height:2.11597in" />

<img src="media/image170.png" style="width:5.43826in;height:2.18781in" />

At this point in the example Application, the ArrivalAlert message
template was complete and it was time to create the DepartureAlert
template. The intended content of the DepartureAlert template was very
close to the structure and content of ArrivalAlert:

-   1 ExampleMessage with:

    -   1 sender

    -   1..99 recipients

    -   1 timestamp

    -   1 type (set to DEPARTURE)

    -   1 flight with:

        -   1 departure with:

            -   1 actualTimeOfDeparture

            -   1 aerodrome

        -   1 gufi

        -   1 flightIdentification with:

            -   1 aircraftIdentification

        -   0..1 flightType

Only the value of the “type” field and the replacement of “arrival” with
“departure” (and associated sub-fields) differed between the two, making
this a good candidate for copying and pasting template content (see
[Copying and Pasting a Template
Package](#copying-and-pasting-a-template-package) below).

Before employing this technique, the portions of DepartureAlert that
were not a good candidate for copy and paste (the Flight package and the
Departure package) were created as described in [Create Template
Content](#create-template-content) above. Below are screenshots of
Project Browser and the restricted Departure package diagram after that
these packages were completed.

### Copying and Pasting a Template Package

Copying and pasting content in EA can be dangerous if proper care is not
taken. It is easy to accidentally create hidden relationships or cause
other unexpected issues. However, it can also be very helpful in terms
of saving effort and avoiding errors that sometimes creep in when
creating content by hand. The restricted FlightData and ExampleMessage
packages from the ArrivalAlert template were good candidates for using
this technique to create corresponding packages under DepartureAlert. In
this example, we began with FlightData.

1.  Right click on package you would like to copy in Project Browser and
    choose “Copy / Paste” and then “Copy to Clipboard” and then “Full
    Structure of Duplication”.

<img src="media/image173.png" style="width:6.5in;height:5.19375in" />

1.  Next, right click on the package under which you want to paste your
    copied package and choose “Copy / Paste” and then “Paste Package
    from Clipboard”. In this example, that was the “Flight” package
    under “DepartureAlert”.

<img src="media/image174.png" style="width:6.5in;height:7.27222in" />

At this point, your copied package has been replicated in the new
location. You will now need to go through it and adjust settings as
needed for this version of the package.

1.  Double click (or right click and choose “Properties…”) on your
    copied package in Project Browser to access and adjust the schema
    properties. In this example, only the *Schema Location* field needed
    to be adjusted. It was modified to use:
    “.\\schemas\\applications\\examplemessage\\exampletemplates\\departurealert\\flight\\flightdata\\ExampleDA\_FlightData.xsd”[24].
    Click OK to save the new settings.

2.  Again, double click (or right click and choose “Properties…”) on
    your copied package in Project Browser and this time click the UML
    button in the upper right hand corner. In the central text box,
    adjust the schema description as needed. In this example, the text
    was changed to read “An example Departure Alert message template for
    the FlightData package.”. Click OK to save the change.

<img src="media/image175.png" style="width:6.5in;height:3.96181in" />

1.  Right click and choose “Properties…” on your diagram name in Project
    Brower. In this example, that was “ExampleAA\_FlightData” within the
    DepartureAlert template.

<img src="media/image176.png" style="width:6.08418in;height:6.35505in" />

1.  This opens the Class Diagram dialogue box. Change the *Name* field
    to something appropriate for your package. In this example,
    “ExampleDA\_FlightData”.

<img src="media/image177.png" style="width:3.72969in;height:0.78136in" />

1.  In Project Browser, delete any unwanted classes from your package by
    right clicking on them and choosing “Delete ‘\[class name\]’”. In
    this example, there were no classes to be deleted.

2.  In Project Brower, double click (or right click and choose
    “Properties…”) on each class in your package and update the *Name*
    field as needed. In this example, each *Name* was modified to use a
    prefix of “ExampleDA\_” rather than “ExampleAA\_”.

<img src="media/image178.png" style="width:5.09446in;height:3.82345in" />

<img src="media/image179.png" style="width:5.09446in;height:3.84429in" />

1.  Now review your class diagram by double clicking on its name (or
    right click it and choose “Open”).

2.  Note any connectors that are no longer desired. Delete these by
    right clicking on them and choosing “Delete Connector”[25]. In this
    example, the “arrival” connector between ExampleDA\_Flight and
    ExampleAA\_Arrival was no longer desired and was removed.

<img src="media/image180.png" style="width:3.76094in;height:5.96958in" />

> When prompted, select the “Delete the connector from the model” radio
> button and then click OK.
>
> <img src="media/image181.png" style="width:2.7608in;height:2.08362in" />
>
> <img src="media/image182.png" style="width:6.5in;height:3.5875in" />

1.  Note any orphaned classes left behind when the unwanted connectors
    have been removed. Click on each in turn and press the delete key
    (or right click on them and choose “Delete ‘\[class name\]’”).
    Unlike connectors, this will only remove the class from the diagram,
    not erase it entirely from the model. In this example, the
    ExampleAA\_Arrival class was deleted from the diagram.

<img src="media/image183.png" style="width:5.61537in;height:1.35436in" />

1.  Next, use the techniques outlined in [Create Template
    Content](#create-template-content) to finish adjusting your package
    with any more changes needed. In this example, that involved
    creating a “departure” association between ExampleDA\_Flight and
    ExampleDA\_Departure (defined in the already created restricted
    Departure package under DepartureAlert). Don’t forget to adjust
    position tags as needed to ensure correct ordering of elements in
    the physical model.

<img src="media/image184.png" style="width:6.5in;height:3.5625in" />

As a final check when performing any copy and paste in Sparx EA, you
will want to review the relationships of each class you copied to ensure
no undesired connections exist.

1.  In the *Start* ribbon at the top of the screen, select
    “Relationships” from the *Windows* section to open the Relationships
    window.

<img src="media/image185.png" style="width:2.09404in;height:0.96889in" />

1.  Click on each class in your package and review the displayed
    relationships for any unexpected connections. In this example, the
    Relationships window revealed an unwanted connection between
    ExampleDA\_Flight and ExampleAA\_ExampleMessage that resulted from
    the copy and paste!

<img src="media/image186.png" style="width:6.5in;height:1.86528in" />

1.  Right click and choose “Delete Connection” for any unwanted
    relationships. Click Yes when asked to confirm the deletion.

<img src="media/image187.png" style="width:5.7508in;height:4.43812in" />

<img src="media/image188.png" style="width:3.8547in;height:1.81275in" />

The steps outlined above were repeated for the ExampleMessage package to
complete the DepartureAlert template. Below are screenshots of Project
Browser and the restricted ExampleMessage package diagram after this
package was completed.

<img src="media/image189.png" style="width:5.1153in;height:7.36561in" />

<img src="media/image190.png" style="width:6.5in;height:2.16667in" />

The templates created for this example were relatively simple and
contained very few fields when compared to FIXM’s entire structure.
However, the techniques outlined in [Create
Templates](#create-templates) were the same ones employed to create the
much larger set of FF-ICE Message templates and should provide the
framework needed to create larger, more complicated templates as needed.

### Create the Includes Package 

The final step in creating Templates is to add an “Includes” package and
appropriate sub-packages. FIXM makes use of “package-wide include files”
to increase its usability with a number of XML tools. The packages
contained under the Includes package facilitate this and will be
modified by the post-processing script to contain the needed content
(see [Set Up and Use Package-Wide Include
Files](#set-up-and-use-package-wide-include-files) below for more
details).

1.  Right click on your overall templates container and choose “Add a
    Package…”.

2.  In the New Package dialogue box, change the *Name* field to
    “Includes”.

3.  Select the “Package Only” radio button and click OK.

<img src="media/image191.png" style="width:3.69843in;height:2.97958in" />

1.  For each namespace your templates both import and restrict (in this
    example, only “http://www.fixm.aero/flight/4.2”), create one
    sub-package under Includes. Like Includes itself, these sub-packages
    will be “Package Only”. Choose a *Name* appropriate to both your
    templates and the schemas they will import. In this example, one
    sub-package was created and it was named “ExampleFlight”.

<img src="media/image192.png" style="width:3.71927in;height:2.94833in" />

1.  Follow the steps detailed in [Apply Schema
    Stereotype](#apply-schema-stereotype), [Set Up Schema
    Properties](#set-up-schema-properties), and [Add Schema Description
    and Tags](#add-schema-description-and-tags) to configure this
    package. The *Target Namespace* and *Prefix* fields should match
    those of the schemas you will be importing, as should the “version”
    tag. The *Schema File* field should be set to something appropriate
    for your templates. In this example, we used:

<!-- -->

1.  *Target Namespace* set to: “http://www.fixm.aero/flight/4.2”.

2.  *Prefix* set to: “fx”.

3.  *Schema File* set to:
    “.\\schemas\\applications\\examplemessage\\exampletemplates\\ExampleFlight.xsd”.

With the Includes package in place, the example Applications Library is
complete. Below are screenshots showing the final composition of Project
Browser and the schemas directory structure.

<img src="media/image193.png" style="width:3.6776in;height:5.33408in" />

<img src="media/image194.png" style="width:2.39617in;height:2.60453in" />

Generate the Application Schemas
--------------------------------

When the Application is complete, it is time to generate the physical
model. The general steps for generating schemas from the logical model
are outlined in the \[place link here\] section of this document.

1.  Begin the process by right clicking on your Application package and
    selecting “Code Engineering” and then “Generate XML Schema…”.

> <img src="media/image195.png" style="width:6.5in;height:5.19722in" />

1.  Then follow the same steps listed in \[place link here\] to set up
    and generate your schemas.

> <img src="media/image196.png" style="width:5.26115in;height:7.19892in" />

Post-Process the Application Schemas
------------------------------------

After the schemas have been generated they will need to be
post-processed. The post-processing script referenced in the \[place
link here\] section will need to be modified in in order to accommodate
your Application.

### Include Application Namespace Prefix

FIXM standardly adds "Type" to the end of the name of all of the types
declared in its schemas. In order to avoid doing this to built-in XSD
types, the post-processing script uses namespace prefixes to determine
which types it should modify. To accommodate this, your Application’s
namespace prefix needs to be added to the script for proper processing.

1.  First, locate the else clause near the end of the script that
    contains the comment:

> \# Add "Type" to the end of all FIXM type names (both declaration and
> use).

1.  In this section, you will see a series of search and replace
    commands. The bottom three of these have a portion that lists out
    all the namespace prefix options used by the FIXM schemas as part of
    the search field. These lines need to be modified to include the
    namespace prefix used by your Application.

For the example created here, this change was implemented as shown below
(modification in red):

> $line =~
> s/&lt;xs:(restriction|extension).\*base="(fb|fx|xmg):\[^"\]\*/$&Type/;
>
> $line =~
> s/&lt;xs:(attribute|element).\*type="(fb|fx|xmg):\[^"\]\*/$&Type/;
>
> $line =~ s/&lt;xs:list.\*itemType="(fb|fx|xmg):\[^"\]\*/$&Type/;

### Set Up and Use Package-Wide Include Files

When parsing schemas, some XML tools only recognize and process the
first “import” element encountered for any given namespace. If a schema
were split across two or more files and only one file were imported due
to this behavior, this would cause obvious problems, as half or more of
your schema could be ignored as a result.

FIXM combats this issue by creating schema files that contain “include”
elements for every single file in a given namespace and then uses these
wide reaching schema files anytime it uses an “import” element. This
way, FIXM only needs one “import” to be processed in order to deliver
the whole schema as intended. FIXM also creates schema files with a mix
of imports and includes to serve as entry points into the standard,
serving the same purpose as the “include” only schema files but also
gathering together everything that will be needed in one place for tools
set up to only process single file schemas.

The term FIXM generally uses when referring to these sorts of files is
“package-wide include files”, or just “include files”, and FIXM makes
broad use of these files to increase its usability with a number of XML
tools. The schema files that will be used for this are generated by
Sparx EA, but it is the post-processing script that creates the actual
import and/or include elements within these files. Depending on the
complexity and structure of your Application, you may need many of
these.

1.  Directly above the section of the post-processing script referenced
    in the previous step (for adding “Type” to type names), locate the
    series of elsif clauses with conditionals along the lines of:

elsif ($schema =~ /\\/\[filename\].xsd/)

1.  At the end of this section, directly after the closing brace of the
    last elsif clause in the series, add your own elsif clauses for
    setting up your Application’s include files. The conditionals need
    to be set up to match your include files’ names.

2.  In the body of the clause, add import and/or include elements for
    the schema files as needed.

The following two subsections discuss how to these clauses should be
constructed in more detail.

#### Include Only Files

Anytime your schema is split across multiple files, you will need to
create an include file to gather all the pieces together in a single
file. For the example Application created here, this happens for the
schemas using the “http://www.fixm.aero/flight/4.2” namespace in three
locations. Once each under the two message templates (ArrivalAlert and
DepartureAlert) and once for the “Includes” file used to gather together
all instances of the flight namespace used throughout the templates in
one place. Below are the elsif clauses used to add the content needed
for these three include only files:

\# Add package-wide includes to ExampleAA\_Flight.xsd

elsif ($schema =~ /\\/ExampleAA\_Flight.xsd/)

{

$line = "\\t&lt;xs:include
schemaLocation=\\"./arrival/ExampleAA\_Arrival.xsd\\"/&gt;\\n" .

"\\t&lt;xs:include
schemaLocation=\\"./flightdata/ExampleAA\_FlightData.xsd\\"/&gt;\\n" .

$line;

}

\# Add package-wide includes to ExampleDA\_Flight.xsd

elsif ($schema =~ /\\/ExampleDA\_Flight.xsd/)

{

$line = "\\t&lt;xs:include
schemaLocation=\\"./departure/ExampleDA\_Departure.xsd\\"/&gt;\\n" .

"\\t&lt;xs:include
schemaLocation=\\"./flightdata/ExampleDA\_FlightData.xsd\\"/&gt;\\n" .

$line;

}

\# Add package-wide includes to ExampleFlight.xsd

elsif ($schema =~ /\\/ExampleFlight.xsd/)

{

$line = "\\t&lt;xs:include
schemaLocation=\\"./arrivalalert/flight/ExampleAA\_Flight.xsd\\"/&gt;\\n"
.

"\\t&lt;xs:include
schemaLocation=\\"./departurealert/flight/ExampleDA\_Flight.xsd\\"/&gt;\\n"
.

$line;

}

#### Import and Include Files

Import and include files serve a similar purpose to the include only
files mentioned above but also act as general entry points, gathering
together everything that would be needed to process a certain part of
FIXM in a single file. There are three such entry points in the example
Application created here. One each for the two message templates
(ArrivalAlert and DepartureAlert) as well as one for the entry point
used to bind these two templates together under the Application
(ExampleTemplates). Below are the elsif clauses used to create the
content needed for these three import and include files:

\# Add package imports/includes to ArrivalAlert.xsd

elsif ($schema =~ /\\/ArrivalAlert.xsd/)

{

$line = "\\t&lt;xs:import
namespace=\\"http://www.fixm.aero/flight/4.2\\"
schemaLocation=\\"./flight/ExampleAA\_Flight.xsd\\"/&gt;\\n" .

"\\t&lt;xs:include
schemaLocation=\\"./examplemessage/ExampleAA\_ExampleMessage.xsd\\"/&gt;\\n"
.

$line;

}

\# Add package imports/includes to DepartureAlert.xsd

elsif ($schema =~ /\\/DepartureAlert.xsd/)

{

$line = "\\t&lt;xs:import
namespace=\\"http://www.fixm.aero/flight/4.2\\"
schemaLocation=\\"./flight/ExampleDA\_Flight.xsd\\"/&gt;\\n" .

"\\t&lt;xs:include
schemaLocation=\\"./examplemessage/ExampleDA\_ExampleMessage.xsd\\"/&gt;\\n"
.

$line;

}

\# Add package imports/includes to ExampleTemplates.xsd

elsif ($schema =~ /\\/ExampleTemplates.xsd/)

{

$line = "\\t&lt;xs:import namespace=\\"http://www.fixm.aero/base/4.2\\"
schemaLocation=\\"../../../core/base/Base.xsd\\"/&gt;\\n" .

"\\t&lt;xs:import namespace=\\"http://www.fixm.aero/flight/4.2\\"
schemaLocation=\\"./ExampleFlight.xsd\\"/&gt;\\n" .

"\\t&lt;xs:include
schemaLocation=\\"./arrivalalert/examplemessage/ExampleAA\_ExampleMessage.xsd\\"/&gt;\\n"
.

"\\t&lt;xs:include
schemaLocation=\\"./departurealert/examplemessage/ExampleDA\_ExampleMessage.xsd\\"/&gt;\\n"
.

$line;

}

### Modify Import Elements to Use Include Files

You will also need to replace “import” elements generated by Sparx EA
with elements that make use of the files you just set up. The
post-processing script handles this task as well, replacing all import
elements for a given namespace with a single import using the include
file. In the example Application created here, only imports using the
“http://www.fixm.aero/flight/4.2” namespace needed to be modified.

1.  Locate the else clause near the beginning of the script that
    contains the comment:

\# Replace Flight package imports with a single import of appropriate
Flight.xsd

1.  Locate the series of elsif clauses in this section with conditionals
    along the lines of:

elsif ($schema =~ /\\/\[template directory name\]\\//)

1.  At the end of this section, directly between the final elsif and the
    closing else clause, add your own elsif clauses for replacing
    existing import statements with ones that make use of the broader
    include files.

In this example, these new clauses were added to address this issue:

elsif ($schema =~ /\\/arrivalalert\\//)

{

$line = $match . "ExampleAA\_Flight.xsd\\"/&gt;\\n";

}

elsif ($schema =~ /\\/departurealert\\//)

{

$line = $match . "ExampleDA\_Flight.xsd\\"/&gt;\\n";

}

Finally, as noted in \[place link here\], be careful not to run your
modified post-processing script against any schema files that have
already been post-processed. To avoid this issue, either regenerate the
Core schemas you need before post-processing the entire schemas
directory or only run the script exclusively against the generated
Applications schemas.

Sample XML

Below is a sample XML document that validates against the ExampleMessage
Application described in this Appendix (using the DepartureAlert

**Rulebook**

Versioning and namespace

-   An Application Library shall have its own version number and
    namespace.

-   An Application Library should employ semantic versioning
    (major.minor.micro) with version number starting at 1.0.0.

Message templates

-   XSD complex type restrictions should be preferably used to pare down
    the FIXM standard to just those fields that are applicable to a
    particular message, as well as to enforce stricter optionality and
    content patterns based on the individual message. One set of these
    restrictions shall exist for each message.

-   XSD profiles may be used as an alternative to XSD restrictions if
    technical issues with XSD restrictions are observed, such as
    incompatibility of XSD restrictions with a marshalling tool.

**Creating an Application Library step by step**

-   When creating a restriction, XML elements are eliminated by removing
    them from the model

-   Optionality, cardinality, and pattern restrictions can all be
    further restricted by applying the desired changes to the restricted
    class.

-   Because XSD complex type restrictions must use the same namespace as
    the types they restrict, it is necessary to change their names.

How to create a FIXM Extension
==============================

Initial Download and Setup
--------------------------

FIXM Extensions can be applied to Core, Applications, or both. Which
FIXM product(s) you begin with is entirely based on the scope of your
Extension.

1.  Determine which FIXM product(s) you wish to target with your
    Extension.

2.  Download the appropriate full release from
    <https://fixm.aero/download.pl>.

3.  Unzip the full release and navigate to the “uml” directory.

4.  Rename the .eap file to something appropriate for your Extension.

5.  Open the model (the .eap file) with Sparx Enterprise Architect[26]
    (EA).

For this guided example, the extension will target both Core and
BasicMessage (download available at
<https://fixm.aero/release.pl?rel=Basic-Msg-1.0.0>). The .eap file was
renamed to
“FIXM\_Example\_Extension\_v1.0.0\_with\_Basic\_Message\_v1.0.0\_and\_Core\_v4.2.0.eap”.
The starting basic directory structure for the example environment is
shown below.

> <img src="media/image197.png" style="width:4.63606in;height:3.95889in" />

Create a Top-Level Extensions Container
---------------------------------------

Before creating the Extension itself, you should first create a
top-level container under which to place your Extension (similar to
Applications).

1.  Right click on the Core package in Project Browser and choose “Add a
    Package…”.

<img src="media/image198.png" style="width:3.108in;height:5.544in" />

1.  In the New Package dialogue box, click on the “…” box next to Owner
    (near the top right corner) to open the Select Owner dialogue box.

2.  In the Select Owner dialogue box, click on Fixm and then click OK.

> <img src="media/image199.png" style="width:6.5in;height:3.09028in" />

1.  In the New Package dialogue box, change the *Name* field to
    “Extensions”, select the *Package Only* radio button, and then click
    OK.

Create an Extension Root Package
--------------------------------

With your Extensions container in place, you can now create and
configure the root package for your Extension.

1.  Right click on the newly created Extensions container and once again
    choose “Add a Package…”.

2.  In the New Package dialogue box, change the *Name* field to
    something appropriate to your Extension (here we used “Example”),
    select the *Package Only* radio button, and then click OK.

> <img src="media/image201.png" style="width:3.77136in;height:3.04209in" />

### Apply Schema Stereotype

In order to generate XSD schemas in Sparx EA, each package that
corresponds to a schema file needs an XSDschema stereotype applied to
it. To add an XSDschema stereotype to your package:

1.  Double click (or right click and choose “Properties…”) on your
    Extension package (here called “Example”) in Project Browser to open
    the Package dialogue box.

2.  In the newly opened Package dialogue box, click on the “…” box next
    to *Stereotype* (near the top right corner) to open the Stereotype
    dialogue box.

3.  In the newly opened Stereotype dialogue box, select “XSDschema” and
    then click OK.

4.  Then click okay in the Package dialogue box to apply the stereotype.

> <img src="media/image202.png" style="width:6.5in;height:3.99931in" />

### Set Up Schema Properties

Once the stereotype is applied, you can configure your schema
properties, setting up a number of XSD details such as schema file name,
schema namespace, namespace prefixes, etc.

1.  Once again, double click (or right click and choose “Properties…”)
    on your Extension package in Project Browser. With the XSDschema
    stereotype applied, this should now open an XSD schema Properties
    dialogue box.

> <img src="media/image203.png" style="width:5.30282in;height:3.50049in" />

1.  Fill in values for your schema properties as appropriate for your
    Extension. In this example, we used the following values:

    1.  *Target Namespace* set to:
        “http://www.fixm.aero/ext/example/1.0”[27].

    2.  *Prefix* set to: “xmp”[28].

2.  You should also specify additional namespace prefixes for any
    packages your Extension will import. In this example, we imported
    Base and Flight from Core as well as BasicMessage. This step is
    accomplished by:

<!-- -->

1.  Clicking “New” to open a Namespace Details dialogue box.

2.  Filling in appropriate details for each namespace to be included.

3.  Then clicking OK.

> See below for examples showing how each Namespace Details dialogue box
> was filled in.
>
> <img src="media/image204.png" style="width:4.17767in;height:1.50021in" />
>
> <img src="media/image103.png" style="width:4.1985in;height:1.50021in" />
>
> <img src="media/image104.png" style="width:4.14641in;height:1.46895in" />

1.  Finally, you must fill in the *Schema File* field with the path to
    your extension directory and an appropriate file name. In this
    example, the following *Schema File* entry was used:
    .\\schemas\\extensions\\example\\Example.xsd.

> <u>IMPORTANT NOTE</u>: Sparx EA will not automatically create any of
> the directories for the path to the file specified in the *Schema
> File* field. **They must be created outside of Sparx EA before
> generating the schemas.** FIXM is natively set up to generate its
> schema files under a directory named “schemas” that is located in the
> same directory as the Sparx EA file. To save time, rather than
> creating all of the directories needed by hand, you can instead:

1.  Copy the “schemas” directory from the FIXM release you started with
    into the directory where your Sparx EA file is located (in this
    example, the “uml” directory from the downloaded release).

2.  Under the “schemas” directory, add an “extensions” directory.

3.  Under the new “extensions” directory, add another directory with a
    name appropriate for your extension (here “example” was used).

> In this example, the new “schemas” directory was added to the “uml”
> directory and was structured as shown below.
>
> <img src="media/image205.png" style="width:2.17739in;height:3.39631in" />

1.  With all of these fields filled out, your XSD schema Properties
    dialogue box should look something like below. Click OK to save
    these settings.

> <img src="media/image206.png" style="width:5.21948in;height:3.43798in" />

### Add Schema Description and Tags

The final step in setting up your schema details is to add a description
for your package and adjust the schema configuration settings that are
controlled in Sparx EA via tagged values.

1.  Once more, double click (or right click and choose “Properties…”) on
    your Extension package in Project Browser and then click the UML
    button (near the top right corner). This will bring you back to your
    Package dialogue box.

2.  In the central text box, fill in a description of your Extension
    package. The text entered here will also show up as a documentation
    element in your schema file.

3.  Next, click on the *Tags* tab (near the lower right hand corner) to
    add three tags used by Sparx EA when creating your schema files:
    attributeFormDefault, elementFormDefault, and version.

    1.  FIXM standardly sets attributeFormDefault to “unqualified”.

    2.  FIXM standardly sets elementFormDefault to “qualified”.

    3.  Version should be set as appropriate for your Extension (“1.0.0”
        in this example).

> To add these tags, click on the third icon from the left
> \[<img src="media/image63.png" style="width:0.19001in;height:0.15347in" />\]
> in the *Tags* tab and fill in the *Tag* and *Value* fields similar to
> what is shown below.
>
> <img src="media/image64.png" style="width:3.76094in;height:1.81275in" />
>
> <img src="media/image65.png" style="width:3.76094in;height:1.81275in" />
>
> <img src="media/image66.png" style="width:3.76094in;height:1.80233in" />

1.  When finished, your Package dialogue box will look something like
    below. Click OK to save these settings.

> <img src="media/image207.png" style="width:6.5in;height:3.98403in" />

Create Extension Content
------------------------

The steps so far have centered on creating and setting up the
Extension’s root package. The number and organization of additional
Extension packages created below the root package (called
“subcomponents” in this document to more easily distinguish them from
the root package) will depend entirely on what the Extension is trying
to accomplish. In this very simple example, the Extension was used to:

-   Add a new field called “position” to the EnRoute section of Core to
    report a flight’s current whereabouts.

-   Add a new field called “sequenceNumber” to the BasicMessage section
    to help with message ordering.

The steps below describe how to create the subcomponents that were used
to contain these new fields.

### Create an Extension Subcomponent

This example will start with creating a subcomponent for the “position”
field. Many of the steps outlined here are very similar to the steps
listed in the [Create an Extension Root Package](#_Create_an_Extension)
section above. The main difference is that Extension subcomponents
contain diagrams and Extension classes.

1.  Right click on the your Extension package and choose “Add a
    Package…”.

2.  Change the *Name* field in the New Package dialogue box to something
    appropriate to your subcomponent (in this example,
    “ExampleEnRoute”).

3.  Select the *Create Diagram* radio button.

4.  Then click OK.

> <img src="media/image208.png" style="width:3.75052in;height:2.99in" />

1.  This will bring up a New Diagram dialogue box. In the *Type*
    section:

    1.  Choose “UML Structural” under *Select From*.

    2.  Choose “Class” under *Diagram Types*.

> Click OK to create the subcomponent and its associated diagram.
>
> <img src="media/image209.png" style="width:5.9375in;height:4.40301in" />

1.  Next, apply the XSDschema stereotype to your subcomponent as
    described in the [Apply Schema
    Stereotype](#_Applying_Schema_Stereotype) section above.

2.  After the stereotype is applied, continue the schema setup as
    described in [Set Up Schema Properties](#set-up-schema-properties)
    above. The following property values were used for this subcomponent
    in this example:

<!-- -->

1.  *Target Namespace* set to: “http://www.fixm.aero/ext/example/1.0”.

2.  *Prefix* set to: “xmp”.

3.  *Schema File* set to:
    “.\\schemas\\extensions\\example\\ExampleEnRoute.xsd”.

> <u>NOTE</u>: For this and other subcomponents, you should be able to
> skip the step of setting up additional namespaces for imported
> packages. Sparx EA should automatically generate these as needed.
>
> When finished, your XSD schema Properties dialogue box should look
> something like below.
>
> <img src="media/image210.png" style="width:5.20906in;height:3.39631in" />

1.  Click OK to save these settings.

2.  Reopen the subcomponent and finish the schema setup as described in
    [Add Schema Description and Tags](#add-schema-description-and-tags).
    As described in that section, the following tags should be added:

<!-- -->

1.  An attributeFormDefault tag set to: “unqualified”.

2.  An elementFormDefault tag to: “qualified”.

3.  A version tag set to an appropriate version for your Extension
    (“1.0.0” for this example).

### Create an Extension Class

Now it is time to create any Extension classes needed. This is typically
done in FIXM by creating new classes that generalize the extension
classes (the classes used throughout Core by its extension hooks) found
in the Extension package located under Core’s Base package (not to be
confused with the similarly referred to “Extension package” you are in
the process of creating).

1.  Double click on your subcomponent’s diagram (or right click it and
    choose “Open”) to get started.

2.  Next, in Toolbox, click on “Complex Type” and then click anywhere in
    the diagram section of the screen. This will open up an XSD
    complexType Properties dialogue box.

3.  Add an appropriate *Name* and *Annotation* for your new class.

4.  Then click OK.

> <img src="media/image68.png" style="width:1.43431in;height:3.464in" />
> <img src="media/image211.png" style="width:4.616in;height:3.48307in" />

1.  Next, right click on your newly created class and choose “Advanced”
    and then “Parent…” to bring up the Set Parents and Interfaces
    dialogue box.

> <img src="media/image212.png" style="width:3.792in;height:4.19794in" />

1.  In the *Add New Relation* section of the dialogue box, set *Type* to
    “Generalizes” and then click on “Choose…” to open up the Select
    Classifier dialogue box.

2.  From there, navigate to Fixm -&gt; Core -&gt; Base -&gt; Extension
    and then choose the Extension class you wish to target. In this
    example, it will be “EnRouteExtension”.

3.  Then click OK.

> <img src="media/image213.png" style="width:6.5in;height:2.59444in" />

1.  Once this is done, you should see that EnRouteExtension is now
    listed in the *Type Details* section of the Set Parents and
    Interfaces dialogue box and is also shown in italics at the top of
    your class in the diagram. Your new class now extends the
    EnRouteExtension extension hook from Core and is ready to be used to
    hold your Extension fields. Click Close.

> <img src="media/image214.png" style="width:6.5in;height:3.40833in" />

### Add Extension Class Content

You can now begin to add content to your new Extension class.

1.  Right click on the class in the diagram and choose “Features and
    Properties” and then “Attributes…”. This opens the Features dialogue
    box. In the Features dialogue box, you can add any attributes[29]
    needed for your Extension to your class.

> <img src="media/image215.png" style="width:4.61571in;height:4.272in" />

1.  Begin by clicking where it says “New Attribute…” under *Name* and
    filling in your new field’s name. In this example, that will be
    “position”.

2.  Then hit the tab key or otherwise click out of the *Name* field.

3.  You should now have a new attribute added to your class with a
    default *Type* of int and *Scope* of Private.

> <img src="media/image216.png" style="width:6.5in;height:3.41181in" />

1.  Next, click on the *Type* field, select the down arrow on the right
    side, and then click “Select Type…”.

> <img src="media/image217.png" style="width:2.43784in;height:2.1253in" />

1.  This opens the Select Type dialogue box. Navigate to the appropriate
    class in the Base package you want to use, select it, and then click
    OK. In this example, that will be Fixm -&gt; Core -&gt; Base -&gt;
    AeronauticalReference -&gt; GeographicalPosition.

> <img src="media/image218.png" style="width:6.48007in;height:4.89652in" />

1.  Next change the *Scope* field to “Public”.

2.  Adjust the *Multiplicity* in the *Attribute* section as needed (in
    this example, it was set to 0..1).

3.  Then add a description for the field in the *Notes* section. When
    finished, your Features dialogue box will look something like below.

> <img src="media/image219.png" style="width:6.5in;height:3.89444in" />

1.  Most optional fields in FIXM are also nillable. If you wish to make
    your field nillable:

<!-- -->

1.  Click on the *Tagged Values* tab.

2.  Click on *Attribute*.

3.  Click on the third icon from the left
    \[<img src="media/image63.png" style="width:0.19001in;height:0.15347in" />\]
    at the top of the tab to add a new tag.

4.  In the *Tag* field type “nillable” and in *Value* type “true” and
    then click OK.

> <img src="media/image220.png" style="width:3.7401in;height:1.77108in" />

1.  Continue adding as many attributes as desired. When finished, click
    Close on the Features dialogue box. The class diagram should display
    the name, type, and multiplicity of each attribute added to the
    class.

> <img src="media/image221.png" style="width:2.17739in;height:0.84387in" />

1.  When satisfied with the subcomponent, right click on its name at the
    top of the diagram and click “Save Changes to ‘\[diagram name\]’”.

> <img src="media/image222.png" style="width:4.15683in;height:2.22948in" />

The class content presented here is simple but keep in mind that as many
attributes and additional Extension-defined classes can be added to this
extension hook as needed.

Along the same lines, the steps detailed under [Create Extension
Content](#_Create_Extension_Content) can be used to add as many
additional subcomponents as needed to hold additional extension hooks or
Extension-specific packages.

Below are a series of screenshots capturing key steps along the way to
creating a second subcomponent for representing the “sequenceNumber”
field needed for extending BasicMessage. The only notable difference
between creating this subcomponent and the previous one is that the
ExampleMessage class created generalizes an extension hook class from
BasicMessage under Applications rather than a class from Extensions
under Base.

<img src="media/image223.png" style="width:2.65582in;height:2.12019in" /><img src="media/image224.png" style="width:3.27079in;height:2.11947in" />

<img src="media/image225.png" style="width:2.959in;height:2.21775in" />
<img src="media/image226.png" style="width:3.39987in;height:2.20247in" />

<img src="media/image227.png" style="width:6.5in;height:3.25278in" />

Generate the Extension Schemas
------------------------------

When all the desired Extension subcomponents are in place, it is time to
generate the schemas for the Extension. The general steps for generating
schemas from the logical model are outlined in the \[place link here\]
section of this document.

1.  Begin the process by right clicking on your Extension root package
    and selecting “Code Engineering” and then “Generate XML Schema…”.

> <img src="media/image228.png" style="width:6.5in;height:5.27431in" />

1.  Then follow the same steps listed in \[place link here\] to set up
    and generate your schemas.

> <img src="media/image229.png" style="width:5.26115in;height:7.20934in" />

Post-Process the Extension Schemas
----------------------------------

After the schemas have been generated they will need to be
post-processed. The post-processing script referenced in the \[place
link here\] section will need to be modified in two ways in order to
accommodate your Extension.

### Include Extension Namespace Prefix

FIXM standardly adds "Type" to the end of the name of all of the types
declared in its schemas. In order to avoid doing this to built-in XSD
types, the post-processing script uses namespace prefixes to determine
which types it should modify. To accommodate this, your Extension’s
namespace prefix needs to be added to the script for proper processing.

1.  First, locate the else clause near the end of the script that
    contains the comment:

> \# Add "Type" to the end of all FIXM type names (both declaration and
> use).

1.  In this section, you will see a series of search and replace
    commands. The bottom three of these have a portion that lists out
    all the namespace prefix options used by the FIXM schemas as part of
    the search field. These lines need to be modified to include the
    namespace prefix used by your Extension.

For the example created here, this change would be implemented as shown
below (modification in red):

> $line =~
> s/&lt;xs:(restriction|extension).\*base="(fb|fx|msg|xmp):\[^"\]\*/$&Type/;
>
> $line =~
> s/&lt;xs:(attribute|element).\*type="(fb|fx|msg|xmp):\[^"\]\*/$&Type/;
>
> $line =~ s/&lt;xs:list.\*itemType="(fb|fx|msg|xmp):\[^"\]\*/$&Type/;

### Set Up and Use Package-Wide Include Files

FIXM makes use of “package-wide include files” that increase its
usability with a number of XML tools. The schema files that will contain
the needed include elements are generated by Sparx EA but it is the
post-processing script that creates the actual include elements within
these files.

Depending on the complexity and structure of your Extension, you may
need many of these but you should always have at least one: the root
schema file corresponding to your Extension’s root package. In this
example, that is the “Example.xsd” file created by the Example package.

1.  Directly above the section of the post-processing script referenced
    in the previous step (for adding “Type” to type names), locate the
    series of elsif clauses with conditionals along the lines of:

elsif ($schema =~ /\\/\[filename\].xsd/)

1.  At the end of this section, directly after the closing brace of the
    last elsif clause in the series, add your own elsif clause for
    setting up your Extension’s root schema file. The conditional needs
    to be set up to match your root schema file’s name (in this example,
    “Example.xsd”).

2.  In the body of the clause, add include elements for the schema files
    of each subcomponent in your Extension as well as an import element
    for the package-wide include file of every set of schemas you use
    with a different namespace then your extension’s own.

For the example created here, the new clause would look like this:

\# Add package-wide includes to Example.xsd

elsif ($schema =~ /\\/Example.xsd/)

{

$line = "\\t&lt;xs:include
schemaLocation=\\"./ExampleEnRoute.xsd\\"/&gt;\\n" .

"\\t&lt;xs:include schemaLocation=\\"./ExampleMessage.xsd\\"/&gt;\\n" .

"\\t&lt;xs:import namespace=\\"http://www.fixm.aero/base/4.2\\"
schemaLocation=\\"../../core/base/Base.xsd\\"/&gt;\\n" .

"\\t&lt;xs:import namespace=\\"http://www.fixm.aero/flight/4.2\\"
schemaLocation=\\"../../core/flight/Flight.xsd\\"/&gt;\\n" .

"\\t&lt;xs:import namespace=\\"http://www.fixm.aero/app/msg/1.0\\"
schemaLocation=\\"../../applications/basicmessage/BasicMessage.xsd\\"/&gt;\\n"
.

$line;

}

Finally, as noted in \[place link here\], be careful not to run your
modified post-processing script against any schema files that have
already been post-processed. To avoid this issue, either regenerate the
Core and/or Applications schemas you need before post-processing the
entire schemas directory or run the script exclusively against the
generated Extension schemas.

Sample XML
----------

Below is a sample XML document that validates against the Example
Extension described in this Appendix:

&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;

&lt;/xmp:position&gt;

&lt;/fx:extension&gt;

&lt;/fx:enRoute&gt;

&lt;/msg:flight&gt;

&lt;/msg:Message&gt;

**Rulebook**

How to generate XML Schemas from a FIXM model using Sparx Enterprise Architect
==============================================================================

Generating Schemas from the Logical Model
-----------------------------------------

The FIXM models are heavily annotated with stereotypes that allow Sparx
Enterprise Architect (EA) to convert the logical model into XML schema
files. This section describes how to invoke XSD generation in Sparx
EA[30].

1.  Open the .eap file that contains the Logical Model you would like to
    build.

2.  Select the component of the model you would like to build in Project
    Browser[31]. For this example, we will be building FIXM Core (model
    available at
    <https://fixm.aero/releases/FIXM-4.2.0/FIXM_Core_v4.2.0.eap>).

3.  Right click on the chosen component (in this example, “Core”) and
    select “Code Engineering” and then “Generate XML Schema…”.

<img src="media/image230.png" style="width:5.27126in;height:4.95588in" />

1.  This brings up the Generate XML Schema dialogue box. There are a
    number of configuration options available in this dialogue box that
    should be set as follows:

    1.  *Encoding*: Set to Unicode (UTF-8)

    2.  *XSD Style*: No options checked.

    3.  *Referenced Package Options*: No options except “Use
        relative-path to reference XSDs” checked.

    4.  *Child Package Options*: “Generate XSD for Child packages”
        checked and “Include &lt;XSDschema&gt; packages” radio button
        selected. Also, all packages you want to build (typically all
        packages listed) checked.

> When finished, your dialogue box should look similar to below.
>
> <img src="media/image231.png" style="width:4.9262in;height:6.73958in" />

As you can see from the list of schema locations under the *Filename*
heading, FIXM is natively set up to generate its schema files into a
directory named “schemas” that is located in the same directory as the
.eap file itself. Sparx EA will <u>not</u> automatically create any of
the directories for the path to the files specified in the *Filename*
fields. **They must be created outside of Sparx EA before generating the
schemas.** The paths shown in the *Filename* fields should give you
guidance as to the required directory structure.

1.  Ensure proper directory structure is in place to hold the generated
    schema files.

For this example, the following directory structure must be placed in
the same directory as the .eap file before attempting to generate the
schemas.

> <img src="media/image232.png" style="width:2.26073in;height:2.69829in" />

This structure could be created by hand or, to save time, you could copy
the “schemas” directory from an appropriate FIXM release, editing it as
needed if you are building a logical model with custom content.

One final note on this topic: at times EA does not appear to recognize
directories created during an open session. As such, it might be best to
close and then reopen the logical model after the appropriate directory
structure has been created to ensure Sparx EA will have access to it.

1.  With the configuration options set and the schema directories in
    place, click the Generate button to produce the physical model.

> <img src="media/image233.png" style="width:5.27157in;height:2.58369in" />

The Progress section of the dialogue box will show each package being
built and will eventually display “Schema Generation Complete” when
finished. There should be no error or warning messages displayed during
this process.

Post-processing the FIXM Schemas
--------------------------------

The schemas generated by Sparx EA require minor post-processing to align
with FIXM best practices and to increase their usability with a number
of XML tools. For FIXM Core, BasicMessage, and FficeMessage, this
post-processing has been automated and is performed by a Perl script,
which makes the following changes to the generated schema files:

-   Adds Base and Flight package imports to Fixm.xsd.

-   Adds package-wide includes to Base.xsd.

-   Adds package-wide includes to Flight.xsd.

-   Adds package-wide includes to Cargo.xsd.

-   Adds package-wide includes to FlightRouteTrajectory.xsd.

-   Replaces Base package imports with a single import of Base.xsd.

-   Replaces Flight package imports with a single import of Flight.xsd.

-   Repeats similar modifications for the Basic Message and FF-ICE
    Message Applications packages.

-   Adds "Type" to the end of all FIXM type names (both declaration and
    use).

-   Alphabetizes attribute declarations.

-   Removes empty sequences (an artifact of Sparx EA schema generation)

The Perl script developed[32] for this task can be found at \[insert
location here\].

When invoking the script, provide the name of the directory containing
the generated schemas as a command line argument. The post-processing
script iterates through all files in the directory as well as all files
in all subdirectories below the supplied directory. The script prints
out the names of all the schema files it detects and processes as it
runs.

1.  Invoke the Perl script to post-process your generated schemas.

In this example, navigate to the directory your “schemas” directory is
located in and then type: “perl postprocess.pl schemas”.

Below is an example invocation of the script against the generated FIXM
Core schemas along with the on-screen output it generates.

> <img src="media/image234.png" style="width:6.5in;height:4.62014in" />

Three final notes about using the post-processing script:

-   The supplied directory should contain only the schema files to be
    processed. Any other files present could be corrupted by this
    script.

-   The script should only be run on the generated schemas once. Running
    the script multiple times will layer additional changes onto the
    schemas each time it is run, resulting in invalid schemas.

-   The script was constructed specifically to run against FIXM Core
    4.2.0, FF-ICE Message 1.0.0, and Basic Message 1.0.0. Running the
    script against any other schemas without modifying the script
    appropriately will likely produce either problematic or insufficient
    modifications to the schemas.

Foreword
--------

This appendix describes a proposed framework for documenting examples of
FIXM implementations using services. This framework is followed for
documenting the examples captured in chapter **Error! Reference source
not found.**.

Needs and Solutions
-------------------

A solution (service) is commonly developed in order to satisfy
operational needs. Therefore, this appendix recommends that both need
and solution are described when documenting a service.

### Describing the Need

Whilst not strictly required, the inclusion of the satisfied operational
needs description is considered a good practice when publishing a FIXM
based service.

The needs can be documented through the description of:

1.  The operational context that benefits from use of the service,

2.  the information exchange requirements that represent a tangible need
    for the service to exist, and

3.  the description of the information that is required to be exchanged
    by the service.

### Describing the Solution

In order to document how the needs that trigger the creation of the
service are satisfied, a description of the solution shall be produced.
This appendix proposes a description framework directly inspired by
initiatives[33] that have explored the subject of service description.
This guidance does not aim to impose a strict framework for documenting
services descriptions; it only identifies a set of topics that are
considered important when describing FIXM based services.

The notion of ***FIXM-based service*** is to be understood in this
chapter as any service created in accordance with the recommendations
described in this guidance document.

Describing FIXM-based services in support of FF-ICE/1
-----------------------------------------------------

The following organized grouping structure is proposed. All aspects
described in it shall be addressed when documenting a FIXM based
service.

<img src="media/image235.png" style="width:6.26389in;height:3.44306in" alt="C:\Users\fghiguer\Desktop\MESSAGING EXPRESS\To be shared\FIXM based service description.png" />

The figure above outlines the different aspects like quality of service
(QoS) or interface specifications that are considered important for
FIXM-based service descriptions. All these aspects are introduced in the
following pages of this appendix, together with examples and in some
cases alternative options.

### General Service Description

The General Service Description covers aspects of special interest for
operational experts like *what does this service do* or *who provides
this service*, in the profile section. In addition, some structural and
behavioural aspects are covered in the design section.

**Profile**

<img src="media/image236.png" style="width:5.23473in;height:2.87736in" alt="C:\Users\fghiguer\Desktop\MESSAGING EXPRESS\To be shared\FIXM based service description - profile.png" />

**Service Function  
**The service functions describe the functionality of the service. A
service function provides a "business view" of a particular service
functionality.

Each service function shall be documented as a combination of a service
function description statement or short passage in plain language and
the description of real world effects that result from invoking the
function. Every service function shall be mapped to an operation defined
as a part of the service's interface.

**Service Provider  
**The organization or entity providing the FIXM based service.

The FIXM based service provider description shall be documented in plain
language.

**Service Consumer  
**An organization or entity consuming the FIXM based service.

FIXM based service consumers description shall be documented in plain
language. Requirements for qualifying as a valid consumer shall be
documented as part of the Service Consumer description.

**Security Aspects  
**A set of collective measures (security mechanisms) that enable the
service to provide protection against security threats such as
unauthorized access to service information; unauthorized disclosure,
modification and destruction of information; unknown status and
repudiation in execution; and denial of service.

Security mechanisms are processes (or devices incorporating such a
process) that are utilized or implemented by the service in order to
address a security threat.

Security protocols or specification documents describe and govern the
implementation of security mechanisms, or, if the mechanism is delegated
to an external security service, a document that specifies that service.

Security aspects shall be documented as appropriate.

**Service Policies  
**A Service Policy is a constraint governing one or more services. A
policy document can be both human-readable and machine-processable.
Applicable service policies shall be documented either textually or by
reference. It is foreseen that service Policies will address backwards
compatibility and version management considerations for a given service.

**Quality of Service  
**A parameter that specifies and measures quality indicators of the
provided service. The Quality of Service specification shall be
documented as part of the FIXM based service description.

**  
**

**Design**

<img src="media/image237.png" style="width:5.23622in;height:2.87818in" alt="C:\Users\fghiguer\Desktop\MESSAGING EXPRESS\To be shared\FIXM based service description - design.png" />

**Service Interface  
**A service interface is a named set (logical grouping) of operations.

**Service Interface Operations  
**Service interface operations provide a "technical view" of a
particular service functionality. A service interface operation is a
named set of messages related to a single service action. Service
Interface Operations shall be documented either as textual descriptions
or/and making use of modelling languages (e.g. UML). The description
shall include as a minimum:

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th><strong>Name</strong></th>
<th><strong>Definition</strong></th>
<th><strong>Notes</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>operation name</strong></td>
<td>A word or phrase used to designate or identify the operation.</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>operation description</strong></td>
<td>A statement or short passage in plain language that describes the pattern and goals of the actions constituting the operation.</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>Input</strong></td>
<td>The name of the input message that initiate interaction with the operation.</td>
<td>Sometimes there is no input, e.g., in notification scenarios.</td>

<td><strong>Output</strong></td>
<td>The name of the output message produced in response to a service request.</td>
<td>Sometimes there is no output, e.g., in solicitation scenarios.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

The description should include if available:

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th><strong>Name</strong></th>
<th><strong>Definition</strong></th>
<th><strong>Notes</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">

<td></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>idempotency</strong><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></td>
<td>A value that indicates whether the operation is "idempotent" or "non-idempotent".</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>precondition</strong></td>
<td>A statement or short passage that describes the state or condition that should be true before the operation can proceed.</td>
<td>This may include request acceptance criteria.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>effect</strong></td>
<td>A statement or short passage that describes the state or condition that exists after the operation is completed, assuming no error has occurred.</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>message exchange pattern</strong></td>
<td>A value that indicates the pattern of message exchange between interacting components.</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<section class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes">
<hr />
<ol>
<li id="fn1" role="doc-endnote"><p>From a service perspective, for an operation (or service call) to be <strong>idempotent</strong>, consumers can make that same call repeatedly while producing the same result.<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
</ol>
</section>

**Service Interactions  
**The purpose of the Service Interactions description is to specify the
service behaviour in terms of how a service interacts with external
agents, and the sequence and dependencies of those interactions.

### Message Description

A message aggregates the data being exchanged -between the service
provider and the consumer- when a service interface operation is
invoked. Each service interface operation may have two messages: input
and output.

Every message identified as input or output of a service interface
operation shall be documented and shall be a FIXM based message.

A FIXM based message is the term chosen to refer to those messages that
are created following the recommendations described in the following
section FIXM Based Messages.

<img src="media/image238.png" style="width:6.26389in;height:3.44306in" alt="C:\Users\fghiguer\Desktop\MESSAGING EXPRESS\To be shared\FIXM based service description - message.png" />

**FIXM Based Messages**

A FIXM based message shall be described as a composition of a FIXM
entry-point element and other API specific elements not covered by the
FIXM core.

The valid FIXM entry-point elements are Message, Message Collection and
Flight.

Every FIXM based message shall be documented either as textual
descriptions or making use of modelling languages (e.g. UML).

**Selection of data  
**Textual description of the content and structure of each message
should be provided as part of the Design section of the service
description. On the Service Implementation Description, the Message Data
Specification must be provided indicating specific FIXM elements used.

**Constraints on Data**

<u>Optionality rules  
</u>When using FIXM 4.1.0, as illustrated in the example services, the
service description document shall define for each of the operation
parameters, which FIXM 4.1.0 elements are mandatory, which are optional,
and the business rules to be applied when determining if an optional
element must be included or not.

The FIXM 4.1.0 elements not included as mandatory or optional:

1.  Can be included in the payload but they will be ignored.

2.  Can’t be included in the payload and its inclusion will suppose an
    error to be delivered by the system receiving the payload. (See
    section on error handling)

3.  Other documented options.

**Other rules  
**The FIXM Based Message Description Artifact, described in the FIXM
Implementation Guidance, shall be included as part of a FIXM Based
Service publication. This description should include any required rule
of constraint relevant in the context of a given Service Operation,
including faults or errors.

### Service Implementation Description

The part of a service description that describes the means by which the
service is invoked, including the underlying technology protocols and
network locations of the service.

<img src="media/image239.png" style="width:6.26389in;height:3.44306in" alt="C:\Users\fghiguer\Desktop\MESSAGING EXPRESS\To be shared\FIXM based service description -service implementation.png" />

**Protocols  
**A formal set of rules governing:

-   data encoding and coordination for data exchange among
    service-oriented architecture components.

-   procedure calls and responses among communicating service-oriented
    architecture components.

-   message transmission and port handling among communicating
    service-oriented architecture components.

-   such combinations as data definitions with messaging conventions or
    messaging and transport governing conventions that cannot be
    unambiguously classified as strictly a data, message, or transport
    protocol.

**End Points  
**An association between a fully-specified binding and a physical point
(i.e., a network address) at which the service may be accessed.

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th><strong>Name</strong></th>
<th><strong>Definition</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>end point name</strong></td>
<td>A word or phrase used to designate or identify the end point.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>end point description</strong></td>
<td>A statement or short passage in plain language that describes the end point.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>network address</strong></td>
<td>A physical point at which the service may be accessed.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

**Other Specifications  
**Other specification documents applicable to the service described.

**Service Interface Specification  
**A WSDL file. “Web services” is a term for a group of industry
standards that collectively provide a mechanism for exchanging XML-based
messages, such as FIXM based messages. One of these standards is the Web
Services Description Language (WSDL), which standardizes the
specification and description of a web services interface.

### Data Implementation Description

<img src="media/image240.png" style="width:6.26389in;height:3.44306in" alt="C:\Users\fghiguer\Desktop\MESSAGING EXPRESS\To be shared\FIXM based service description -data implementation.png" />

**Message Data Specification  
**When a message is created as a composition of elements from FIXM, it
is likely that more elements than those intended to be used in the
actual message instances are imported. Therefore, it is mandatory to
document which are the elements that shall be used when exchanging a
given message.

The content of the message shall be documented for every FIXM based
message. A list of the used elements is proposed for this purpose.

**FIXM XML Schemas**

Chapter 1.1 provides guidance on how to use XML Schemas to document
FIXM/based Messages.

### Service Behaviour

To illustrate the planning service behavior and associated interactions,
four cases are distinguished:

-   The ***Preliminary Flight Plan Message*** submission is rejected
    (***REJ or NON CONCUR***). For details see \[10\] Page II-4-13
    Section 4.4.5.4 and \[10\] Page II-5-29 Section 5.3.7 iii

-   The ***Preliminary Flight Plan Message*** submission is accepted
    (***ACK & CONCUR***). For details see \[10\] Page II-4-13 Section
    4.4.5.2/4.4.5.3 and \[10\] Page II-5-28 Section 5.3.7 i

-   The ***Preliminary Flight Plan Message*** submission requires manual
    intervention (***MAN***). For details see \[10\] Page II-4-13
    Section 4.4.5.5

-   The ***Preliminary Flight Plan Message*** submission requires
    negotiation (**NEGOTIATE**) as described in \[10\] Page II-5-29
    Section 5.3.7 ii

Case a) Planning Service with REJ or non-concur preliminary flight plan

**Description  
**This example illustrates the submission of a new preliminary flight
plan that is rejected by the eASP for any reason, be it technical (such
as syntax error in the request) or operational (such as penetrating a
closed airspace).

**Expected FF-ICE interaction**

<span id="_Toc498700597" class="anchor"></span>Figure : FF-ICE
interaction for REJ or non-concur flight plan submission

According to the FF-ICE/1 Implementation Guidance Manual \[10\], the
submission could be:

1.  Rejected immediately for having failed data acceptability: in this
    case a ***Submission Response*** = ***REJ*** is used and no
    ***Planning Status Message*** is to follow.

2.  Accepted with respect to data acceptability but not accepted due to
    operational acceptability: if the data acceptability is performed at
    a later stage this should result in a ***Submission Response*** =
    ***ACK*** followed by a ***Planning Status*** ***Message*** with the
    errors.

**Example implementation**

Flight plan submission example with preliminary flight plan rejected for
having failed data acceptability (REJ)

-   The PreliminaryFlightPlanSubmissionRequest contains the flight plan
    encoded in FIXM 4.1.0.

-   The PreliminaryFlightPlanSubmissionReply contains the status
    ***REJ*** and the reason.

<img src="media/image243.png" style="width:5.46389in;height:1.69306in" />

<span id="_Toc40797577" class="anchor"></span>Figure : Preliminary
Flight plan submission example with preliminary flight plan rejected for
having failed operational acceptability (NON CONCUR)

-   The preliminaryFlightPlanSubmissionRequest contains the flight plan
    encoded in FIXM 4.1.0.

-   The preliminaryFlightPlanSubmissionReply contains the status
    ***ACK***.

-   The planningStatusMaessage contains the ***Planning Status*** with
    status ***NON CONCUR.***

Whatever the submission operation, the FF-ICE/1 Implementation Guidance
Manual \[10\] always makes a distinction between data acceptability and
operational acceptability. However, some eASP may want to perform the
two together as part of the same transaction. This would translate into
the following figure.

<span id="_Toc40797578" class="anchor"></span>Figure : Preliminary
Flight plan submission example with rejected (REJ or ACK+NON CONCUR)
preliminary flight plan

In this example, the data acceptability and operational acceptability
are combined into the same transaction. The resulting synchronous reply
conveys all necessary information: the ***REJ*** status and the
operational reason that led to the ***NON CONCUR***. As outlined by the
diagram, the interaction only takes place as a R/R and does not need to
generate any asynchronous messages.

-   The PreliminaryFlightPlanSubmissionRequest contains the flight plan
    encoded in FIXM 4.1.0.

-   The PreliminaryFlightPlanSubmissionReply contains the status
    ***REJ*** and the reason or ***ACK*** and ***NON CONCUR***. In
    FF-ICE/1 terminology this reply implements both the ***Submission
    Response*** and the ***Planning Status***.

Case b) Planning Service with CONCUR (operationally acceptable)
preliminary file plan

**Description**  
This example illustrates the submission of a new preliminary flight plan
that is accepted by the eASP.

Figure 18 mirrors the distinction between data acceptability and
operational acceptability that is introduced by the FF-ICE/1
Implementation Guidance. However, both aspects may be addressed
technically as part of the same transaction, as illustrated by Figure
19.

In this example, the data acceptability and operational acceptability
are combined into the same transaction. The request is processed
successfully and the preliminary flight plan is ***CONCUR***
(operationally acceptable).

-   The preliminaryFlightPlanSubmissionRequest contains the preliminary
    flight plan encoded in FIXM 4.1.0.

-   The preliminaryFlightPlanSubmissionReply contains the status
    ***ACK*** and the accepted preliminary flight plan encoded in FIXM
    4.1.0. In FF-ICE terminology this reply contains both the
    ***Submission Response*** and the ***Planning Status***.

that requires negotiation.

    status ***NEGOTIATE.***

Figure 21 mirrors the distinction between data acceptability and
operational acceptability that is introduced by the FF-ICE/1
Implementation Guidance. However, both aspects may be addressed
technically as part of the same transaction:

<span id="_Toc40797584" class="anchor"></span>Figure : Preliminary
Flight plan submission example with preliminary flight plan that

In this example, the data acceptability and operational acceptability
are again combined into the same transaction. The request is processed
successfully and the preliminary flight plan is ***NEGOTIATE***
(requires negotiation).

-   The preliminaryFlightPlanSubmissionRequest contains the preliminary
    flight plan encoded in FIXM 4.1.0.

-   The preliminaryFlightPlanSubmissionReply contains the status
    ***ACK*** and the proposed for negotiation preliminary flight plan
    encoded in FIXM 4.1.0. In FF-ICE terminology this reply contains
    both the ***Submission Response*** and the ***Planning Status***.

### Service Behaviour

To illustrate the filing service behaviour and associated interactions,
three cases are distinguished:

1.  The ***Filed Flight Plan*** is rejected (***REJ or NOT
    ACCEPTABLE***), as described in (resp.) \[10\] Page II-4-13 Section
    4.4.5.4 and Page II-6-2 Section 6.3.4 ii.

2.  The ***Filed Flight Plan*** is accepted (***ACK and ACCEPTABLE***),
    as described in (resp.) \[10\] Page II-4-13 Section
    4.4.5.2/4.4.5.3and Page II-6-1 Section 6.3.4 i

3.  The ***Filed Flight Plan*** requires manual intervention
    (***MAN***), as described in \[10\] Page II-4-13 Section 4.4.5.5

Case a) Filing Service with non-acceptable flight plan

**Description**  
This example illustrates the submission of a new flight plan that is
rejected by the eASP for any reason, be it technical (such as syntax
error in the request) or operational (such as penetrating a closed
airspace).

**  
**

**Expected FF-ICE interaction**

<span id="_Toc498700589" class="anchor"></span>Figure : FF-ICE
interaction for non-acceptable flight plan submission

According to the FF-ICE conceptual document the submission could be:

1.  Rejected immediately for having failed data acceptability: in this
    case a ***Submission Response* = *REJ*** is used and no ***Filing
    Status Message*** is to follow.

2.  Accepted with respect to data acceptability but not accepted due to
    operational acceptability: if the data acceptability is performed at
    a later stage this should result in a ***Submission Response*** =
    ***ACK*** followed by a ***Filing Status*** with the errors.

**Example implementation**

<img src="media/image248.png" style="width:5.11458in;height:1.55764in" />

<span id="_Toc40797587" class="anchor"></span>Figure : Flight plan

-   The flightPlanSubmissionRequest contains the flight plan encoded in
    FIXM 4.1.0

-   The flightPlanSubmissionReply contains the status ***REJ*** and the
    reason.

<span id="_Toc40797588" class="anchor"></span>Figure : Flight plan

failed operational acceptability (NOT ACCEPTABLE)

-   The flightPlanSubmissionRequest contains the flight plan encoded in
    FIXM 4.1.0.

-   The flightPlanSubmissionReply contains the status ***ACK***.

-   The filingStatusMaessage contains the ***Filing Status*** with
    status ***NON ACCEPTABLE.***

As noted already for the Planning Service, both data acceptability and
operational acceptability may be addressed technically as part of the
same transaction.

<span id="_Ref508205480" class="anchor"></span>Figure : Flight plan
filing submission example with rejected (REJ or ACT+NON ACCEPTABLE)
filed flight plan

By doing so, the synchronous reply conveys all necessary information:
the ***REJ*** status and the operational reason that led to the
***REJ***. As shown in Figure 27, the interaction only takes place as a
R/R and does not need to generate any asynchronous messages.

The flightPlanSubmissionReply contains the status ***REJ*** and the
reason. In FF-ICE terminology this reply implements both the
***Submission Response*** and the ***Filing Status.***

Case b) Filing Service with acceptable file plan

**Description  
**This example illustrates the submission of a new flight plan that is
accepted by the eASP. Having combined data acceptability and operational
acceptability into the same transaction, this means the request was
processed successfully, and the flight plan is operationally acceptable.

-   The flightPlanSubmissionRequest contains the flight plan encoded in
    FIXM 4.1.0.

-   The flightPlanSubmissionReply contains the status ***ACK***.

-   The FilingStatusMessage contains the ***Filing Status*** with status
    ***ACCEPTABLE.***

Once again, both data acceptability and operational acceptability may be
addressed technically as part of the same transaction.

<span id="_Toc40797592" class="anchor"></span>Figure : Flight plan
filing submission example with accepted (ACK and ACCEPTABLE) filed
flight plan

By doing so, the synchronous reply conveys all necessary information:
the ***ACK*** status and the accepted flight plan with the accepted
trajectory.

-   The flightPlanSubmissionReply contains the status ***ACK*** and the
    accepted flight plan encoded in FIXM 4.1.0. In FF-ICE terminology
    this reply contains both the ***Submission Response*** and the
    ***Filing Status***.

**  
**

Case c) Filing Service with manually treated flight plan

**Description  
**This example illustrates the submission of a new flight plan that is
queued for manual intervention (***MAN***).

**Expected FF-ICE interaction**

<img src="media/image251.png" style="width:4.08889in;height:1.60972in" />

<span id="_Toc498700593" class="anchor"></span>Figure : FF-ICE
interaction for manually treated flight plan

In case a flight plan submission requires manual treatment, FF-ICE
foresees a ***Submission Response***=***MAN*** followed by a subsequent
asynchronous ***Submission Response*** which could be ***ACK*** or
***REJ***, followed by an optional ***Filing Status*** that would
contain the accepted flight plan or the reasons why it was not accepted
(***NOT ACCEPTABLE***).

**Example implementation**

<img src="media/image252.png" style="width:5.59931in;height:1.66667in" />

<span id="_Toc498700594" class="anchor"></span>Figure : Flight plan
filing example with manually treated flight plan

-   The flightPlanSubmissionRequest contains the flight plan encoded in
    FIXM 4.1.0.

-   The flightPlanSubmissionReply contains the status ***MAN*** and the
    accepted flight plan encoded in FIXM 4.1.0. In FF-ICE terminology
    this reply contains both the ***Submission Response*** and the
    ***Filing Status***.

-   The FlightFilingResultMessage contains the result of the processing
    (***ACK*** or ***REJ***). In case of rejection it contains the
    reason why the flight plan was not accepted, in case of acceptance
    it contains the accepted flight plan. In practice it contains both
    the ***Submission Response*** and the ***Filing Status***.

-   The FilingStatusMessage is sent only in case the submitted flight
    plan is accepted (***ACK***) and it contains the accepted flight
    plan encoded in FIXM 4.1.0.

#### Message Description

The FF-ICE/1 Implementation guidance manual \[10\], Appendix C – FF-ICE
Messages details *the required and allowed data elements for each of the
FF-ICE messages.* That part of the manual is not repeated in this
section.

#### Data Implementation Description

This part will be addressed in a future version of the document.

Technical assumptions
---------------------

The FF-ICE/1 Implementation Guidance \[10\] mentions synchronous (e.g.
***Submission Response Message***) and asynchronous replies (e.g.
***Filing Status Message***) but does not provide definitions for these
terms. This complicates the interpretation of the FF-ICE/1 interactions.
For example does synchronous mean the client blocks until the server
replies or does it simply mean “timely”?

The chapter assumes the following:

1.  The request submission and the synchronous response are realized as
    SOAP request/reply.

2.  The asynchronous response is realized via an AMQP notification
    (which can be thought of as a message queue).

This is shown in the following diagram.

<img src="media/image253.png" style="width:4.07292in;height:1.5625in" />

<span id="_Ref508186374" class="anchor"></span>Figure : Synchronous and
asynchronous communication between eAU and eASP

In all the following examples, the diagrams will use the colour scheme
introduced by Figure 11: orange for synchronous communication, purple
for asynchronous.

### Setting up for asynchronous notifications

In order to setup the AMQP endpoint from which to receive the
asynchronous notifications the eAU needs to express such an interest to
the eASP.

The initiative to establish a connection could be on either side (client
or server). For example, the eAU could provide its own AMQP end-point to
which the eASP shall connect to publish the asynchronous notifications.
Conversely, an AMQP end-point could be created on the server side and
the client could connect to it to fetch the notifications. The latter
has the clear advantage of leveraging the server (i.e. the eASP) from
having to deal with all security-related issues (such as VPNs, firewall
rules, authentication, etc) for each eASP.

In the examples provided below, the eAU can invoke a specific web
service operation createSubscription by which it requests the eASP to
create an AMQP end-point on the server side to which it can then connect
to fetch the asynchronous notifications.

This is shown in the following diagram:

<img src="media/image254.png" style="width:5.07292in;height:1.47431in" />

<span id="_Toc40797596" class="anchor"></span>Figure :
SubscriptionCreationRequest to setup the AMQP end-point

The content of the SubscriptionCreationRequest should contain enough
information to allow the eASP to decide which notifications shall be
sent on this AMQP end-point (i.e. for which flights). Typically, the
subscription should at least cover all the flights filed or operated by
the eAU.

For example the content of such a request could be:

1.  Create a subscription for all flight plans operated by *\[operator
    name/id\]*

2.  Create a subscription for all flight plans submitted by *\[eAU
    name/id\]*

3.  Create a subscription for all flight plans flown by the following
    aircrafts *\[aircraft id\]*

4.  Create a subscription for all flight plans departing/arriving
    from/to the given airports *\[aerodrome id\]*

5.  Create a subscription for all flight plans that concern a given
    control centre *\[control centre id\]*

The content of the SubscriptionCreationReply contains the URL of the
AMQP end-point to which the eAU can connect.

This operation is to be invoked only once. Note that this AMQP channel
could also be created manually by the eASP following an agreement
between the eAU and the eASP.

All the examples in this chapter foresee the existence of this AMQP
channel. There will be four types of asynchronous messages:

1.  the FlightPlanningResultMessage,

2.  the PlanningStatusMessage,

3.  the FlightFilingResultMessage

4.  the FilingStatusMessage,

These messages are further explained in the following chapters.

Message classification and technology selection
-----------------------------------------------

FF-ICE/1 Messages can be classified from the perspective of the
participant who provides the service. Two types of messages can be
identified: input messages and output messages. The input messages are
those received by the service provider while the output messages are
sent by the service provider.

According to the classification above, the FF-ICE/1 Messages can be
classified as following:

1.  ***Planning Service***

    1.  Input messages:

        1.  ***Preliminary Flight Plan Message***, as specified in
            \[10\] Page II-E-3 Section C-2

        2.  ***Flight Plan Update Message**,* as specified in \[10\]
            Page II-E-19 Section C-9

        3.  ***Flight Cancellation Message***[34] as specified in \[10\]
            Page II-E-17 Section C-8

    2.  Output messages:

        1.  ***Submission Response Message**,* as specified in \[10\]
            Page II-C-1 Section C-1

        2.  ***Planning Status Message**,* as specified in \[10\] Page
            II-E-8 Section C-3

2.  ***Filing Service***

    1.  Input messages:

        1.  ***Filed Flight Plan Message**,* as specified in \[10\] Page
            II-E-10 Section C-4

        2.  ***Flight Plan Update Message**,* as specified in \[10\]
            Page II-E-19 Section C-9

        3.  ***Flight Cancellation Message<sup>8</sup>**,* as specified

    2.  Output messages:

        1.  ***Submission Response Message**,* as specified in \[10\]
            Page II-C-1 Section C-1

        2.  ***Filing Status Message**,* as specified in \[10\] Page
            II-E-14 Section C-5

3.  ***Flight Data Request Service***

    1.  Input messages:

        1.  ***Flight Data Request Message**,* as specified in \[10\]
            Page II-E-24 Section C-10

    2.  Output messages:

        1.  ***Flight Data Response Message**,* as specified in \[10\]
            Page II-E-26 Section C-11

        2.  ***Submission Response Message**,* as specified in \[10\]
            Page II-C-1 Section C-1

Messages can be arranged according to the source that sends the message;
however, the initiative of the communication is another aspect to be
evaluated to select a suitable service implementation.

In all the input messages introduced above, the initiative of the
communication is taken by the service consumer; these messages are
called *requests*. Every time a service provider receives a *request*
message, they will send back an output message. Those output messages,
known as *reply* messages, are triggered by the reception of the
*request* message and therefore the initiative of such communication is
taken by the service consumer.[35]

In contrast, some output messages can be sent by the service provider on
its own initiative. These messages are called push messages or
*notification* messages.[36]

In order to document the FIXM-Based examples in this section, two sets
of technologies have been selected that accommodate the need to exchange
request, reply, and notification messages:

-   **SOAP Web Service technologies** allow to exchange request and
    reply messages where the initiative is taken by the service
    consumer.[37]

-   **AMQP** supports the exchange of notification messages where the
    initiative is taken by the service provider.

The following set of tables describes a possible design of FIXM-Based
Services in support of the FF-ICE/1 Services described in \[10\].

Use of Schematron
=================

There is some validation functionality that an XML schema alone cannot
provide. For example, there is no way for an XSD to make a particular
XML element required or optional based on the content of another
element. However, some message exchange business rules require exactly
these sorts of checks.

Schematron is a validation language capable of handling business rules
of this nature. As such, the use of Schematron can supplement the
limitations of XSDs and provide enforcement of any business rules
outside the scope of what XML schemas can offer.

**Error! Reference source not found.** provides examples of FIXM
business rules that could be encoded and checked using Schematron
technology. Schematron encodings are however not provided in this
version of the document. Future versions may revisit the overall
formulation and description method for FIXM business rules, in
particular in the light of the related AIXM experience.

What do you want to know, prove, demonstrate, analyze, test, investigate
or examine? List your project goals…for example…

•The goal of this research is to:

oIllustrate a new methodology/architecture/product/invention that has
never been built before

oDetermine the efficacy of your new
method/architecture/product/invention

oCreation of a research roadmap as it pertains to my new

upon?

Hypotheses (optional)

Depending on the nature of you research, hypothesis might not be stated
up front. For example, if you choose a qualitative research

method that leverages grounded theory, then a the “theory” is an
emergent property at the END of your research (i.e., a theory is

developed inductively not deductively when using grounded theory).
However, if your method is Quantitative or Design Science

oriented, then you should include verbiage upfront in your proposal that

Introduction
------------

Typically, the development of data exchange standards are based on
Logical and Physical Model best practices. Logical Models use UML best
practices to show the relationships between key concepts whereas the
Physical Model use schema best practices to develop the data exchange
standard. The development of different standards deviate from best
practices to accommodate unique use cases required by stakeholders.
Although it is not the responsibility of exchange models to be
“compatible” with various development tools, compatibility is indeed
critical for stakeholder and industry adoption making an analysis of
Development Tool Compatibility essential.

To this end, a compatibility analysis was run against the FIXM schemas
and

-   a variety of technologies (e.g., SOAP, REST, JMS) 

-   several common development tools.  

The result of this compatibility analysis was the creation of the FIXM
support matrix. The section below titled *Platform Support Matrix*
supplies a list of the supported tools and technologies. This list of
currently supported software versions is also located on the FIXM work
area.

Evaluation Environment
----------------------

The evaluation process included the following components:

1.  **FIXM Schemas**

    1.  FIXM Core 4.2.0

    2.  FF-ICE Message 1.0.0 (with restrictions)

2.  **WSDL file**

Two WSDL files were tested

1.  The first file contained FIXM schema details that contained no
    restrictions.

2.  The second filed contained FIXM schema details that contained
    restrictions.

<!-- -->

1.  **FlightPlanningService Web Service**

The FIXM test web service being evaluated here is called
*FlightPlanningService*, which supports one operation called
*submitFlightPlan*. Developer can issue a submitFlightPlan remote
request, as either a REST or SOAP call, to the FIXM
*FlightPlanningService* and receive a submission response from the
Service.

> This is a very basic web service to test the sending of minimal flight
> plan XML via SOAP to a server in an attempt to get a web service
> SubmissionResponse. Testing focused mainly on Java based client and
> server.

The below sections will outline the approach and findings associated
with the evaluation of various tools tested in interpreting the Fixm
WSDL file to produce the Fixm server and client Java code.

A number of tools were tested but the Apache Axis library and the
WSDL2Java tool were found to provide the most success.

**<u>Example WSDL (FIXM Schema with Restrictions)</u>**

<img src="media/image255.png" style="width:7.375in;height:7.75in" />

Apache Axis library and the WSDL2Java tool
------------------------------------------

The Apache Axis library provides the WSDL2java tool, which can interpret
WSDL files. Axis1 and Axis2 versions were tested.

Before running the WSDL2Java tool required two questions needed to be
answered:

**Which data binding parameter option to pass to it?**

Two data binding options, ADP and JAXBRI, were tested. These options
provide two different approaches when interpreting schemas to create
data models in JAVA.

ADP uses its own Axis1 based parsing tool. Supports limited validation
but no range checking

JAXBRI uses JAXB as a parsing tool. Utilize JAXB for schema validation
in the code (big timesaving). It does not support parameter testing but
does support limited field checking i.e. ‘Required’ versus ‘Optional’

**Where to Run It?**

***Option 1 –Through an IDE using an Axis plugin***

The IDE used did not have a deciding impact on the results. However,
they did determine the Data Binding option selected. Developers cannot
specify the data binding through the IDE as the IDE interacts with the
WSDL2Java tool at the backend. IDEs are Axis1 based and run WSDL2Java
with the default data binding option ADP.

For this option, the only variant is the WSDL2Java tool version (i.e.
Axis1 or Axis2) as the data binding option remains the same therefore

***Option2 – From the command-line***

For this approach, testing focused on the Axis2 version only as Axis1
failed to generate any code through the IDEs.

Developers can specify the data binding option from the command-line
when executing WSDL2Java command.

Both options were tested i.e. ADP and JAXBRI.

For this option, the only variant was the data binding option, as the
WSDL2Java tool version remains the same.

**Note**: Testing of the JAXBRI data binding was carried out for the
command-line option only.

Evaluation Results
------------------

### Definitions

**<u>Pass Outcome</u>**

Succeeded in generating compilable and runnable Fixm server and client
code. The process to achieve this may or may not have required
additional coding.

**<u>Failed Outcome</u>**

Failed in generating compilable and runnable Fixm server and client
code. No additional workarounds were available or the amount of coding
needed made the solution impractical.

### Pass Outcomes

Future Testing
--------------

The growth of the FIXM Support Matrix needs to be the responsibility of
the entire FIXM community.  Coordinated feedback and testing is strongly
encouraged between all FIXM community members.

Examples of potential areas for testing include:

-   ASP.net Web Client

    -   Visual Studio/.NET (for RESTful WS) on Windows 10

    -   Visual Studio/.NET (for SOAP WS) on Windows 10

-   ASP.net Web Services

-   WSDL to Java Tools - JAX-RS in Eclipse (using NetBeans)

-   Linux Operating system

Appendix F. Developing a Basic Web Service Using FIXM (Server and Client)
=========================================================================

The following outlines the steps to build a basic FIXM web service.

<img src="media/image256.png" style="width:7.68472in;height:4.1875in" />

1.  <span id="_Toc40867326" class="anchor"></span>**Generate
    JAXB-RI-Bound Source Code**

> Execute the WSDL2Java command (from the command-line)
>
> <img src="media/image257.png" style="width:6.06335in;height:2.1253in" />
>
> Successful execution results in the generation of:

A PANS-ATM ATS message field may be mapped to different FIXM elements
depending on context. A simple constraint notation based on logic and
set theory is employed to specify these conditions. The notation is
described in Table 10.

The term ‘〈kind〉’ in the subsequent tables (fields 8, 13, 15, 16 and
18) is a reference to the kind of route/trajectory information to which
a field is mapped. That route information is dependent on the message
type. Refer to section Varieties of Route for a mapping between the
message type and the kind of route information.

##### Field 3

Field 3 in an ATS message denotes the message type. FIXM is concerned
with modelling information that may be included in a message, but FIXM
itself does not define messages (section **Error! Reference source not
found.**). As such, there is no equivalent of ATS field 3 in FIXM.

##### Field 22

In an ATS message, field 22 specifies a change to the information
associated with a flight. It does not define new information elements,
just a modification to elements that appear in other fields. As such,
there are no mapping rules for field 22. The mapping of the information
that can be specified in field 22 is captured in the other fields. For
example, the entry *-7/NEWACID* in field 22 has the same mapping as if
*–NEWACID* appeared in field 7 (on page 110).

[1] When newer versions of FIXM products are released, upgrading the
restrictions only requires updating the reference to the newer versions
and implementing the ad-hoc adaptations only for the parts that have
changed.

[2] FIXM does not use GML but mimics it for geographic positions. GML
encodes geographic locations as sequences of values since it employs the
same construct to represent polygons.

Application Library.

Service*** are not covered by this example.

Service operations indicate the intent or the results of the information
exchange.

[8] It is assumed that validation of the flight plan ensures when code
‘N’ is included in field 10a, no other code is included, but such
validation is not part of the translation rules.

[9] It is assumed that validation of the flight plan ensures the field
10a code ‘R’ is always paired with field 18 PBN, but such validation is
not part of the translation rules.

[10] It is assumed that validation of the flight plan ensures the field
10a code ‘Z’ is always paired with at least one of field 18 NAV, COM or
DAT, but such validation is not part of the translation rules.

[11] It is assumed that validation of the flight plan ensures when code
‘N’ is included in field 10b, no other code is included, but such
validation is not part of the translation rules.

[12] If field 18 DOF is omitted it is necessary to apply business rules
to calculate the date of flight. Such business rules are outside the
scope of this chapter. The responsibility lies with individual
stakeholders.

[13] Note that each Extension must target the same version of FIXM Core
and/or Application Library in order to be used together. For example,
you cannot combine one Extension that uses FIXM Core 4.2.0 with another
Extension that uses FIXM Core 4.1.0.

[14] Starting with the Basic Message v1.0.0 model and then deleting the
BasicMessage package allows you to skip creating and setting up the
Applications container and associated schema directory.

[15] The FIXM development team uses Sparx Systems Enterprise Architect
version 13.5, build 1352 for all development work.

[16] Note that a package in Sparx EA can have more than one associated
diagram. To date, FIXM products have only created one diagram per
package, though.

[17] Though FIXM tends to use namespaces that look like URLs, the
namespace value do not need to resolve to an actual location on the
Internet. The namespace is just a field used to resolve naming
collisions between schemas and should, therefore, be distinctive enough
to ensure a reasonably high chance it is not used by another schema.

[18] This example used “xmg” but the prefix can be set to any value that
makes sense in the context of your Application. Because it will be used
throughout your generated schemas, a short prefix is typically
preferred.

[19] This is important because XSD complex type restrictions, the
mechanism used to create the templates, must use the same namespace as
the types they restrict. Because of this, different versions of
templates are not able to use distinct namespaces to distinguish
themselves from each other. Tying the versioning of the templates to the
versioning of the Application package and changing that versioning each
time the templates change solves this issue.

[20] Note, this only applies to the package itself – not the contents of
the package. Creating the contents of the message template is covered in
[Create Template Contents](#create-template-content).

[21] XML attributes, rarely used in this version of FIXM, are handled
differently. If you wish to remove an XML attribute from your restricted
class, the field must be retained but the “use” tag associated with the
field must be set to a value of “prohibited”.

[22] If deleted, these associations will be removed entirely from the
model, including Core! It is very important that you <u>do not</u> do
this.

[23] It is important to note that this substitution of a restricted
class for the class it is derived from can also be done for attributes.
If your templates add restrictions to any classes defined in Core’s Base
package, use them when specifying the *Type* field of your attributes as
needed. The FficeMessage templates provide examples of this for the
PersonOrOrganization class.

[24] Don’t forget to create any needed directories outside of Sparx EA
to accommodate your schema structure.

[25] Note that it is very important to explicitly delete any unwanted
connectors. If you instead delete the class in the diagram that the
connector is attached to, this will remove the connector from the
diagram but it will still exist within the model. This can cause
undesired elements to be created when generating the physical model.

version 13.5, build 1352 for all development work.

[27] Though FIXM tends to use namespaces that look like URLs, the
namespace value do not need to resolve to an actual location on the
Internet. The namespace is just a field used to resolve naming
collisions between schemas and should, therefore, be distinctive enough
to ensure a reasonably high chance it is not used by another schema.

[28] This example used “xmp” but the prefix can be set to any value that
makes sense in the context of your extension. Because it will be used
throughout your generated schemas, a short prefix is typically
preferred.

[29] In FIXM, attributes are standardly used when the field you are
adding is of a Type defined in the Core’s Base package. When defining
your own types, they are standardly attached to a class by using an
association instead. In this example, we will be adding a new field of
type GeographicalPosition from the AeronauticalReference package under
Base so using an attribute is the appropriate choice.

[30] The FIXM development team uses Sparx Systems Enterprise Architect
version 13.5, build 1352 for all development work.

[31] This could be the root package of an entire FIXM product (for
example, the Core package or the FficeMessage package under
Applications) or a particular sub-section or individual sub-package (for
example, the Base package under Core or the EnRoute package under
Flight) of a FIXM product.
